  <h2 class='c003'>FOREWORD</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>I recollect riding late one night along
the high-road from Galle to Colombo. The
road skirts the shore. On the left hand the
long breakers of the Indian Ocean broke in
ripples on the rocks in the many little bays.
On the right an endless vista of tall cocoanut
palms waved their top-knots over a park-like
expanse of grass, and the huts of the peasantry
were visible here and there beneath the trees.
In the distance a crowd had gathered on the
sward, either seated on the grass or leaning
against the palms. I turned aside—no road
was wanted—to see what brought them there
that moonlight night.</p>

<p class='c005'>The villagers had put an oval platform
under the trees. On it were seated yellow
robed monks with palm-leaf books on their
laps. One was standing and addressing the
folk, who were listening to <i>Bana</i>, that is
<a id='Page_viii'></a>“The Word”—discourses, dialogues, legends,
or stories from the Pali Canon. The stories
were the well-known Birth-stories, that is the
ancient fables and fairy-tales common to the
Aryan race which had been consecrated, as
it were, by the hero in each, whether man or
animal, being identified with the Buddha in
a former birth. To these wonderful stories
the simple peasantry, men, women and children,
clad in their best and brightest, listen
the livelong night with unaffected delight,
chatting pleasantly now and again with their
neighbors; rising quietly and leaving for a
time, and returning at their will, and indulging
all the while in the mild narcotic of the betel-leaf,
their stores of which afford a constant
occasion for acts of polite good-fellowship.
Neither preachers nor hearers may have that
deep sense of evil in the world and in themselves,
nor that high resolve to battle with and
overcome it, which animated some of the first
disciples. They all think they are earning
“merit” by their easy service. But there is at
least, at these full-moon festivals, a genuine
feeling of human kindness, in harmony alike
<a id='Page_ix'></a>with the teachings of Gotama and with the
gentle beauty of those moonlit scenes.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c006'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>See</i> Rhys Davids’ <i>Buddhism</i> (S.P.C.K.), pp. 57, 58.</p>
</div>

<p class='c005'>It is not only under the palm groves of
the South that these stories are a perennial
delight. Wherever Buddhism has gone they
have gone with it. They are known and loved
on the plains of Central Asia, in the valleys
of Kashmir and Afghanistan, on the cold
tablelands of Nepal, Tartary and Tibet,
through the vast regions of India and China,
in the islands of Japan and the Malay archipelago,
and throughout the jungles of Siam
and Annam.</p>

<p class='c005'>And not only so. Soldiers of Alexander
who had settled in the East, wandering merchants
of many nations and climes, crusading
knights and hermits who had mixed with
Eastern folk, brought the stories from East
to West. They were very popular in Europe
in the Middle Ages; and were used, more especially
by the clergy, as the subjects of numerous
homilies, romances, anecdotes, poems
and edifying plays and mysteries. The character
of the hero of them in his last or former
<a id='Page_x'></a>births appealed so strongly to the sympathies,
and especially to the religious sympathies, of
mediæval Christians that the Buddha (under
another name) was included, and has ever
since remained, in the list of canonized saints
both in the Roman and Greek Churches; and
a collection of these and similar stories—wrongly
but very naturally ascribed to a famous
story-teller of the ancient Greeks—has
become the common property, the household
literature, of all the nations of Europe; and,
under the name of Æsop’s Fables, has handed
down, as a first moral lesson-book for our
children in the West, tales first invented to
please and to instruct our far-off cousins in
the distant East.</p>

<p class='c005'>So the story of the migration of the stories
is the most marvelous story of them all.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c006'><sup>[2]</sup></a> And,
strange to say, in spite of the enormous outpouring
of more modern tales, these old ones
have not, even yet, lost their charm. I used
to tell them by the hour together, to mixed
<a id='Page_xi'></a>audiences, and never found them fail. Out of
the many hundred Birth-stories there are only
a small proportion that are suitable for children.
Miss Shedlock, so well known on both
sides of the Atlantic for her skill and judgment
in this regard, has selected those she
deems most suitable; and, so far as I can
judge, has succeeded very admirably in adapting
them for the use of children and of teachers
alike. Much depends, no doubt, upon the telling.
Could Miss Shedlock herself be the teller,
there would be little doubt of the success. But
I know from my own experience that less able
story-tellers have no cause at all to be discouraged.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For the details of this story the introduction to my
<i>Buddhist Birth Stories</i> may be consulted; and for the history
of the Jâtakas in India the chapter on that subject in my
<i>Buddhist India</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The reason is, indeed, not far to seek. The
stories are not ordinary ones. It is not on
sharpness of repartee, or on striking incidents,
that their charm depends. These they have
sometimes. But their attraction lies rather in
a unique mixture of subtle humor, cunning
make-belief, and earnestness; in the piquancy
of the contrast between the humorous incongruities
and impossibilities of the details, and
the real serious earnestness, never absent but
<a id='Page_xii'></a>always latent, of the ethical tone. They never
raise a boisterous laugh: only a quiet smile of
delighted appreciation; and they leave a pleasant
aroma behind them. To the child-mind
the impossibilities are no impossibilities at all,
they are merely delightful. And these quaint
old-world stories will continue to appeal to
children, young and old, as they have done, the
world over, through the long centuries of the
past.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>T. W. Rhys Davids.</span></p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_xiii'></a>
  <h2 class='c003'>EDITOR’S PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>These stories of the Buddha-Rebirths are
not for one age or for one country, but for
all time, and for the whole world. Their philosophy
might be incorporated into the tenets
of faith of a League of Nations without destroying
any national forms of religious teaching.
On the other hand those who prefer the
foundation of more orthodox views will be
astonished to find their ethics are identical with
many of those inculcated in the stories: here
we find condemnation of hypocrisy, cruelty,
selfishness, and vice of every kind and a constant
appeal to Love, Pity, Honesty, loftiness
of purpose and breadth of vision. And should
we reject such teachings because they were
given to the World more than 2,000 years ago?
Since it is wise to take into consideration the
claims and interests of the passing hour it is
well to re-introduce these stories at a moment
<a id='Page_xiv'></a>when, perhaps more than ever before, East
and West are struggling to arrive at a clearer
understanding of one another.</p>

<p class='c005'>In Tagore’s essay on the relation of the Individual
to the Universe, he says: “In the West
the prevalent feeling is that Nature belongs
exclusively to inanimate things and to beasts;
that there is a sudden unaccountable break
where human nature begins. According to it,
everything that is low in the scale of beings is
merely nature, and whatever has the stamp of
perfection on it, intellectual or moral, is human
nature. It is like dividing the bud and
the blossom into two separate categories and
putting their grace to the credit of two different
and antithetical principles. But the Indian
mind never has any hesitation in acknowledging
its kinship with nature, its unbroken
relation with all.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This is perhaps the best summing up of the
value of this collection. Since the publication
of the book in 1910, I have had many opportunities
of testing the value of the dramatic
appeal in these stories both for adults and boys
and girls of adolescent age. When presented
<a id='Page_xv'></a>at this impressionable period, the inner meaning
will sink more deeply into their minds than
the same truths presented in a more direct
and didactic fashion.</p>

<p class='c005'>I am greatly indebted to Professor Rhys
Davids, not only because he has placed the
material of his translations from the Pali at
my disposal, but also because of his unfailing
kindness and help in directing my work. I
am fortunate to have had the restraining influence
of so great a scholar so that I might not
lose the Indian atmosphere and line of thought
which is of such value in these stories.</p>

<p class='c005'>I most gratefully acknowledge my indebtedness
to the Cambridge Press, by whose courtesy
I have been able to include several of
the stories published in their volumes.</p>

<p class='c005'>I present here a selection from over 500
stories.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>To this new and enlarged edition of Eastern
Stories and Legends, Miss Shedlock
has brought years of dramatic experience in
the telling of stories to children and grown
people in England and America, and united
with it a discriminating selection from the
work of a great Oriental scholar.</p>

<p class='c005'>The result is a book of intrinsic merit for
the general reading of children and of great
practical value to all who are concerned with
moral or ethical training.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I feel a great joy in what these stories can
unconsciously bring to the reader,” says Miss
Shedlock in a personal letter, “the mere living
among the stories for the past few weeks has
given me a sense of calm and permanence
which it is difficult to maintain under present
outward conditions.”</p>

<p class='c005'>I have observed with growing interest, extending
<a id='Page_xx'></a>over a period of years, the effect of
such stories as “The Folly of Panic” and “The
Tree Spirit” upon audiences of adolescent
boys and girls in the public schools, public libraries,
social settlements, Sunday schools and
private schools, I have visited with Miss Shedlock.
There is in Miss Shedlock’s rendering
something more than a suggestion of kinship
with Nature and the attributes of animal life.
The story is told in an atmosphere of spiritual
actuality remote from our everyday experience
yet confirming its eternal truths.</p>

<p class='c005'>My familiarity with the earlier edition of
Eastern Stories and Legends and my personal
introduction of “The True Spirit of a Festival
Day” and other stories to audiences of
parents and teachers, enables me to speak with
confidence of the value of the book in an enlarged
and more popular form.</p>

<p class='c005'>In rearranging and expanding her selection
of stories Miss Shedlock has wisely freed
the book from limitations which gave it too
much the appearance of a text book. In so doing
she has preserved the classical rendering
of her earlier work. Her long experience as
<a id='Page_xxi'></a>a teacher and story-teller in England and
America informs her notes and arouses in the
mature reader a fresh sense of the “power to
educate” which rises out of all great literature
at the touch of a true interpreter.</p>

  <a id='Page_1'></a>
  <h2 id='chap01' class='c003'>THE HARE THAT RAN AWAY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'><a id='Page_3'></a>And it came to pass that the Buddha (to
be) was born again as a Lion. Just as
he had helped his fellow-men, he now began
to help his fellow-animals, and there was a
great deal to be done. For instance, there was
a little nervous Hare who was always afraid
that something dreadful was going to happen
to her. She was always saying: “Suppose the
Earth were to fall in, what would happen to
me?” And she said this so often that at last
she thought it really was about to happen.
One day, when she had been saying over and
over again, “Suppose the Earth were to fall in,
what would happen to me?” she heard a slight
noise: it really was only a heavy fruit which
had fallen upon a rustling leaf, but the little
Hare was so nervous she was ready to believe
anything, and she said in a frightened tone:
“The Earth <i>is</i> falling in.” She ran away as
fast as she could go, and presently she met an
<a id='Page_4'></a>old brother Hare, who said: “Where are you
running to, Mistress Hare?”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the little Hare said: “I have no time to
stop and tell you anything. The Earth is falling
in, and I am running away.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The Earth is falling in, is it?” said the old
brother Hare, in a tone of much astonishment;
and he repeated this to <i>his</i> brother hare, and <i>he</i>
to <i>his</i> brother hare, and <i>he</i> to <i>his</i> brother hare,
until at last there were a hundred thousand
brother hares, all shouting: “The Earth is
falling in.” Now presently the bigger animals
began to take the cry up. First the deer, and
then the sheep, and then the wild boar, and
then the buffalo, and then the camel, and then
the tiger, and then the elephant.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now the wise Lion heard all this noise and
wondered at it. “There are no signs,” he said,
“of the Earth falling in. They must have
heard something.” And then he stopped them
all short and said: “What is this you are saying?”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the Elephant said: “I remarked that
the Earth was falling in.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How do you know this?” asked the Lion.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_5'></a>“Why, now I come to think of it, it was the
Tiger that remarked it to me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the Tiger said: “<i>I</i> had it from the
Camel,” and the Camel said: “<i>I</i> had it from
the Buffalo.” And the buffalo from the wild
boar, and the wild boar from the sheep, and
the sheep from the deer, and the deer from
the hares, and the Hares said: “Oh! <i>we</i> heard
it from <i>that</i> little Hare.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the Lion said: “Little Hare, <i>what</i> made
you say that the Earth was falling in?”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the little Hare said: “I <i>saw</i> it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You saw it?” said the Lion. “Where?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yonder, by the tree.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said the Lion, “come with me and
I will show you how——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, no,” said the Hare, “I would not go
near that tree for anything, I’m <i>so</i> nervous.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But,” said the Lion, “I am going to take
you on my back.” And he took her on his
back, and begged the animals to stay where
they were until they returned. Then he
showed the little Hare how the fruit had fallen
upon the leaf, making the noise that had frightened
her, and she said: “Yes, I see—the
<a id='Page_6'></a>Earth is <i>not</i> falling in.” And the Lion said:
“Shall we go back and tell the other animals?”
And they went back. The little Hare stood
before the animals and said: “The Earth is
<i>not</i> falling in.” And all the animals began to
repeat this to one another, and they dispersed
gradually, and you heard the words more and
more softly:</p>

<p class='c005'>“The Earth is <i>not</i> falling in,” etc., etc., etc.,
until the sound died away altogether.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—This story I have told in my own words, using the
language I have found most effective for very young children.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_9'></a>
  <h2 id='chap02' class='c010'>THE MONKEY AND THE CROCODILE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Once upon a time, while Brahmadatta
was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta
came to life at the foot of Himalaya as a Monkey.
He grew strong and sturdy, big of
frame, well-to-do, and lived by a curve of the
river Ganges in a forest haunt.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now at that time there was a Crocodile
dwelling in the Ganges. The Crocodile’s mate
saw the great frame of the monkey, and she
conceived a longing for his heart to eat. So
she said to her lord: “Sir, I desire to eat the
heart of that great king of the monkeys!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good wife,” said the Crocodile, “I live in
the water and he lives on dry land: how can
we catch him?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“By hook or by crook,” she replied, “caught
he must be. If I don’t get him, I shall die.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“All right,” answered the Crocodile, consoling
<a id='Page_10'></a>her, “don’t trouble yourself. I have a
plan; I will give you his heart to eat.”</p>

<p class='c005'>So when the Bodhisatta was sitting on the
bank of the Ganges, after taking a drink of
water, the Crocodile drew near, and said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sir Monkey, why do you live on bad fruits
in this old familiar place? On the other side
of the Ganges there is no end to the mango
trees, and labuja trees, with fruit sweet as
honey! Is it not better to cross over and have
all kinds of wild fruit to eat?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lord Crocodile,” the Monkey made answer,
“deep and wide is the Ganges: how shall
I get across?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you will go, I will mount you on my
back, and carry you over.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The Monkey trusted him, and agreed.
“Come here, then,” said the other, “up on my
back with you!” and up the Monkey climbed.
But when the Crocodile had swum a little way,
he plunged the Monkey under the water.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good friend, you are letting me sink!” cried
the Monkey. “What is that for?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Said the Crocodile, “You think I am carrying
you out of pure good nature? Not a bit of
<a id='Page_11'></a>it! My wife has a longing for your heart, and
I want to give it to her to eat!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Friend,” said the Monkey, “it is nice of
you to tell me. Why, if our heart were inside
us when we go jumping among the tree-tops,
it would be all knocked to pieces!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, where do you keep it?” asked the
other.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Bodhisatta pointed out a fig-tree, with
clusters of ripe fruit, standing not far off.
“See,” said he, “there are our hearts hanging
on yon fig-tree.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you will show me your heart,” said the
Crocodile, “then I won’t kill you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Take me to the tree, then, and I will point
it out to you hanging upon it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The Crocodile brought him to the place. The
Monkey leapt off his back, and climbing up the
fig-tree sat upon it. “O silly Crocodile!” said
he, “you thought that there were creatures that
kept their hearts in a tree-top! You are a fool,
and I have outwitted you! You may keep
your fruit to yourself. Your body is great,
but you have no sense.” And then to explain
this idea he uttered the following stanzas:</p>
<div class='lg-container-l c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_12'></a>“Rose-apple, jack-fruit, mangoes too across the water there I see;</div>
      <div class='line'>Enough of them, I want them not; my fig is good enough for me!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Great is your body, verily, but how much smaller is your wit!</div>
      <div class='line'>Now go your ways, Sir Crocodile, for I have had the best of it.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The Crocodile, feeling as sad and miserable
as if he had lost a thousand pieces of money,
went back sorrowing to the place where he
lived.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_15'></a>
  <h2 id='chap03' class='c003'>THE SPIRIT THAT LIVED IN A TREE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>And it came to pass that the Buddha was
re-born as a Tree-Spirit. Now there
reigned (at Benares) at that time a King who
said to himself: “All over India, the kings live
in palaces supported by many a column. <i>I</i> will
build me a palace resting on one column only—then
shall I in truth be the chiefest of all
kings.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Now in the King’s Park was a lordly Sal
tree, straight and well-grown, worshiped by
village and town, and to this tree even the
Royal Family also paid tribute, worship, and
honor. And then suddenly there came an order
from the King that the tree should be cut
down.</p>

<p class='c005'>And the people were sore dismayed, but the
woodmen, who dared not disobey the orders of
the King, came to the Park with hands full of
perfumed garlands, and encircling the tree
<a id='Page_16'></a>with a string, fastened to it a nosegay of flowers,
and kindling a lamp, they did worship, exclaiming:
“O Tree! on the seventh day must
we cut thee down, for so hath the King commanded.
Now let the Deities who dwell within
thee go elsewhither, and since we are only
obeying the King’s command, let no blame fall
upon us, and no harm come to our children
because of this.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the Spirit who lived in the tree, hearing
these words, reflected within himself and said:
“These builders are determined to cut down
this tree, and to destroy my place of dwelling.
Now my life lasts only as long as this tree.
And lo! all the young Sal trees that stand
around, where dwell the Deities my kinsfolk—and
they are many—will be destroyed! My
own destruction does not touch me so near as
the destruction of my children: therefore must
I protect their lives.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Accordingly, at the hour of midnight
adorned in divine splendor, he entered into
the magnificent chamber of the King, and filling
the whole chamber with a bright radiance,
stood weeping beside the King’s pillow. At
<a id='Page_17'></a>the sight of him, the King, overcome with terror,
said: “Who art thou, standing high in
the air, and why do thy tears flow?”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the Tree-God made answer: “Within
thy realm I am known as the Lucky-Tree.
For sixty thousand years have I stood, and
all have worshiped me, and though they have
built many a house, and many a town, no
violence has been done to me. Spare thou me,
also, O King.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the King made answer and said:
“Never have I seen so mighty a trunk, so
thick and strong a tree; but I will build me
a palace, and thou shalt be the only column
on which it shall rest, and thou shalt dwell
there for ever.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the Tree said: “Since thou art resolved
to tear my body from me, I pray thee cut me
down gently, one branch after another—the
root last of all.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the King said: “O Woodland Tree!
what is this thou askest of me? It were a
painful death to die. One stroke at the root
would fell thee to the ground. Why wouldst
thou die piecemeal?”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_18'></a>And the Tree made answer: “O King!
My children, the young Sal trees, all grow
at my feet: they are prosperous and well sheltered.
If I should fall with one mighty crash,
behold these young children of the forest would
perish also!”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the King was greatly moved by this
spirit of sacrifice, and said: “O great and
glorious Tree! I set thee free from thy fear,
and because thou wouldst willingly die to save
thy kindred, thou shalt not be cut down. Return
to thy home in the Ancient Forest.”</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_21'></a>
  <h2 id='chap04' class='c003'>THE HARE THAT WAS NOT AFRAID TO DIE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>And it came to pass that the Buddha was
born a Hare and lived in a wood; on one
side was the foot of a mountain, on another
a river, on the third side a border village.</p>

<p class='c005'>And with him lived three friends: a Monkey,
a Jackal, and an Otter; each of these
creatures got food on his own hunting ground.
In the evening they met together, and the
Hare taught his companions many wise things:
that the moral law should be observed—that
alms should be given to the poor, and that
holy days should be kept.</p>

<p class='c005'>One day the Buddha said: “To-morrow is
a fast day. Feed any beggars that come to
you by giving from your own store of food.”
They all consented.</p>

<p class='c005'>The next day the Otter went down to the
bank of the Ganges to seek his prey. Now
a fisherman had landed seven red fish and had
<a id='Page_22'></a>buried them in the sand on the river’s bank
while he went down the stream catching more.
The Otter scented the buried fish, dug up the
sand till he came upon them, and he called
aloud: “Does any one own these fish?” And,
not seeing the owner, he laid the fish in the
jungle where he dwelt, intending to eat them
at a fitting time. Then he lay down, thinking
how virtuous he was.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Jackal also went off in search of food,
and found in the hut of a field watcher a
lizard, and a pot of milk-curd.</p>

<p class='c005'>And, after thrice crying aloud, “To whom
do these belong?” and not finding an owner,
he put on his neck the rope for lifting the pot,
and grasping the spits and lizard with his
teeth, he laid them in his own lair, thinking,
“In due season I will devour them,” and then
he lay down, thinking how virtuous he had
been.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Monkey entered the clump of trees, and
gathering a bunch of mangoes, laid them up in
his part of the jungle, meaning to eat them
in due season. He then lay down and thought
how virtuous he had been.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_23'></a>But the Hare (who was the Buddha-to-be)
in due time came out thinking to lie (in contemplation)
on the Kuca grass. “It is impossible
for me to offer <i>grass</i> to any beggars who
may chance to come by, and I have no oil or
rice or fish. If any beggar come to me, I will
give him (of) my own flesh to eat.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Now when Sakka, the King of the Gods,
heard this thing, he determined to put the
Royal Hare to the test. So he came in disguise
of a Brahmin to the Otter and said:
“Wise Sir, if I could get something to eat,
I would perform <i>all</i> my priestly duties.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The Otter said: “I will give you food.
Seven red fish have I safely brought to land
from the sacred river of the Ganges. Eat thy
fill, O Brahmin, and stay in this wood.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the Brahmin said: “Let it be until to-morrow,
and I will see to it then.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then he went to the Jackal, who confessed
that he had stolen the food, but he begged the
Brahmin to accept it and remain in the wood;
but the Brahmin said: “Let it be until to-morrow,
and then I will see to it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And he came to the Monkey, who offered
<a id='Page_24'></a>him the mangoes, and the Brahmin answered
in the same way.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the Brahmin went to the wise Hare,
and the Hare said: “Behold, I will give thee
of my flesh to eat. But thou must not take
life on this holy day. When thou hast piled
up the logs I will sacrifice myself by falling
into the midst of the flames, and when my
body is roasted thou shalt eat it and perform
all thy priestly duties.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Now when Sakka heard these words he
caused a heap of burning coals to appear, and
the Wisdom Being, rising from the grass, came
to the place, but before casting himself into
the flames he shook himself, lest perchance
there should be any insects in his coat who
might suffer death. Then, offering his body
as a free gift, he sprang up, and like a royal
swan, lighting on a bed of lotus in an ecstasy
of joy, he fell on the heap of live coals. But
the flame failed even to heat the pores of the
hair on the body of the Wisdom Being, and it
was as if he had entered a region of frost.
Then he addressed the Brahmin in these words:
“Brahmin, the fire that thou hast kindled is
<a id='Page_25'></a>icy cold; it fails to heat the pores of the hair
on my body. What is the meaning of this?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“O most wise Hare! I am Sakka, and have
come to put your virtue to the test.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the Buddha in a sweet voice said: “No
god or man could find in me an unwillingness
to die.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Sakka said: “O wise Hare, be thy
virtue known to all the ages to come.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And seizing the mountain he squeezed out
the juice and daubed on the moon the signs
of the young hare.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then he placed him back on the grass that
he might continue his Sabbath meditation and
returned to Heaven.</p>

<p class='c005'>And the four creatures lived together and
kept the moral law.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_29'></a>
  <h2 id='chap05' class='c003'>THE PARROT THAT FED HIS PARENTS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Now it came to pass that the Buddha was
re-born in the shape of a Parrot, and he
greatly excelled all other parrots in his
strength and beauty. And when he was full
grown his father, who had long been the leader
of the flock in their flights to other climes, said
to him: “My son, behold my strength is spent!
Do thou lead the flock, for I am no longer
able.” And the Buddha said: “Behold, thou
shalt rest. I will lead the birds.” And the
Parrots rejoiced in the strength of their new
leader, and willingly did they follow him.
Now from that day on, the Buddha undertook
to feed his parents, and would not consent that
they should do any more work. Each day he
led his flock to the Himalaya Hills, and when
he had eaten his fill of the clumps of rice that
grew there, he filled his beak with food for the
dear parents who were waiting his return.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_30'></a>Now there was a man appointed to watch
the rice-fields, and he did his best to drive
the Parrots away, but there seemed to be some
secret power in the leader of this flock which
the Keeper could not overcome.</p>

<p class='c005'>He noticed that the Parrots ate their fill
and then flew away, but that the Parrot-King
not only satisfied his hunger, but carried away
rice in his beak.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now he feared there would be no rice left,
and he went to his master the Brahmin to
tell him what had happened; and even as the
master listened there came to him the thought
that the Parrot-King was something higher
than he seemed, and he loved him even before
he saw him. But he said nothing of this, and
only warned the Keeper that he should set a
snare and catch the dangerous bird. So the
man did as he was bidden: he made a small
cage and set the snare, and sat down in his
hut waiting for the birds to come. And soon
he saw the Parrot-King amidst his flock, who,
because he had no greed, sought no richer spot,
but flew down to the same place in which he
had fed the day before.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_31'></a>Now, no sooner had he touched the ground
than he felt his feet caught in the noose. Then
fear crept into his bird-heart, but a stronger
feeling was there to crush it down, for he
thought: “If I cry out the Cry of the Captured,
my Kinsfolk will be terrified, and they
will fly away foodless. But if I lie still, then
their hunger will be satisfied, and they may
safely come to my aid.” Thus was the Parrot
both brave and prudent.</p>

<p class='c005'>But alas! he did not know that his Kinsfolk
had nought of his brave spirit. When
<i>they</i> had eaten their fill, though they heard
the thrice-uttered cry of the captured, they
flew away, nor heeded the sad plight of their
leader.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then was the heart of the Parrot-King sore
within him, and he said: “All these my kith
and kin, and not one to look back on me. Alas!
what sin have I done?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The Watchman now heard the cry of the
Parrot-King, and the sound of the other Parrots
flying through the air. “What is that?”
he cried, and leaving his hut he came to the
place where he had laid the snare. There he
<a id='Page_32'></a>found the captive Parrot; he tied his feet together
and brought him to the Brahmin, his
master. Now, when the Brahmin saw the Parrot-King,
he felt his strong power, and his
heart was full of love to him, but he hid his
feelings and said in a voice of anger: “Is thy
greed greater than that of all other birds?
They eat their fill, but thou takest away each
day more food than thou canst eat. Doest thou
this out of hatred for me, or dost thou store up
the food in some granary for selfish greed?”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the Great Being made answer in a
sweet human voice: “I hate thee not, O Brahmin.
Nor do I store the rice in a granary for
selfish greed. But this thing I do. Each day
I pay a debt which is due—each day I grant a
loan, and each day I store up a treasure.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Now the Brahmin could not understand the
words of the Buddha (because true wisdom
had not entered his heart), and he said: “I
pray thee, O Wondrous Bird, to make these
words clear unto me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And then the Parrot-King made answer:
“I carry food to my ancient parents who
can no longer seek that food for themselves:
<a id='Page_33'></a>thus I pay my daily debt. I carry food to
my callow chicks whose wings are yet ungrown.
When I am old they will care for me—this
my loan to them. And for other birds,
weak and helpless of wing, who need the aid
of the strong, for them I lay up a store; to
these I give in charity.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then was the Brahmin much moved, and
showed the love that was in his heart. “Eat
thy fill, O Righteous Bird, and let thy Kinsfolk
eat too, for thy sake.” And he wished to
bestow a thousand acres of land upon him, but
the Great Being would only take a tiny portion
round which were set boundary stones.</p>

<p class='c005'>And the Parrot returned with a head of
rice, and said: “Arise, dear Parents, that I
may take you to a place of plenty.” And he
told them the story of his deliverance.</p>

  <a id='Page_37'></a>
  <h2 id='chap06' class='c003'>THE MAN WHO WORKED TO GIVE ALMS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Once upon a time the Buddha was born
as a merchant named Vissaya (and being
endowed with the Five Virtues) he was
liberal and fond of alms-giving. He had alms
halls built at the four city gates, in the heart
of the city, and at the door of his own house.
At these points he set on foot alms-giving and
every day 600,000 men went forth to beg and
the food of the beggar and the merchant was
exactly the same. And as he thus stirred up
the people of India by his gifts, Sakka, the
King of the gods, grew suspicious and thought,
“This Vissaya gives alms and by scattering his
gifts everywhere is stirring up all India. By
means of his alms-giving, methinks he will dethrone
me and himself become Sakka. I will
destroy his wealth, and make him a poor man,
and so bring it about that he shall no longer
give alms.” So Sakka caused his oil, honey,
<a id='Page_38'></a>molasses and the like, and all his treasure of
grain to disappear, as well as his slaves and
work people. Those who were deprived of his
gifts came and said, “My Lord, the alms hall
has disappeared. We do not find anything in
the various places set up by you.” “Take
money hence,” he said. “Do not cut off the
giving of alms.” And calling his wife, he bade
her keep up her charity. She searched the
whole house, and not finding a single bit of
money, she said, “My Lord, except the clothes
we wear, I see nothing. The whole house is
empty.” Opening the seven jewel treasuries
they found nothing, and save the merchant and
his wife no one else was seen, neither slaves nor
hirelings. The merchant, again addressing his
wife, said, “My dear, we cannot possibly cut
off our charities. Search the whole house till
you find something.”</p>

<p class='c005'>At that moment a certain grass-mower
threw down his sickle and pole and the rope for
binding the grass in the doorway, and ran
away. The merchant’s wife found them and
said: “My Lord, this is all I see,” and brought
and gave them to him. Said he: “All these
<a id='Page_39'></a>years I have never mown grass before, but to-day
I will mow grass, and take and sell it, and
by this means dispense the fitting alms.”</p>

<p class='c005'>So, through fear of having to cut off his charities,
he took the sickle, and the pole and the
rope, and going forth from the city came to
a place of much grass, and mowing it, tied it
up in two bundles, saying, “One shall belong
to us, and with the other I will give alms.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This he did for six days, and because there
was not enough to feed all who came for alms,
on the seventh day, he and his wife went fasting.
Then his strength gave out. No sooner
did the heat of the sun strike upon his head
than his eyes began to swim in his head, and he
became unconscious, and falling down he scattered
the grass. Sakka was moving about, observing
what the merchant did. And that god,
standing in mid-air, cried: “Refrain from giving,
and thou shalt have joy for ever.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who art thou?” cried the merchant.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am Sakka.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the merchant said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sakka reached his high office by taking
upon himself moral duties, and giving alms.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_40'></a>“Why dost thou give alms?” asked Sakka,
still wishing to test him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is not because I desire Sakkahood nor
Brahmaship, but through giving there cometh
knowledge of all things.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Great merchant,” cried Sakka, “henceforth
do thou every day give alms.” And all his
wealth was restored to him.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_43'></a>
  <h2 id='chap07' class='c003'>THE KING WHO SAW THE TRUTH</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Long, long ago the Wisdom Child that
should in time become the Buddha was
born a King. He was kind and generous, distributing
all sorts of alms to the poor; nor
did he leave the work to those under him: he
took a personal part in the giving of the gifts—and
nearly every day came himself to the
Alms Hall to see that none went away empty-handed.</p>

<p class='c005'>But one morning, as he lay meditating on
what he still might do for his people, he began
to feel that, after all, he had done no
very great thing, and he said: “I have given
to my people only <i>outside</i> things—the mere
gold and silver and raiment and food that I
can well spare, and lo! this giving brings me no
joy. If I could only give my people part of
myself—some precious thing which would
show my love for them—whatever it might
cost me! And if to-day, when I go down to
<a id='Page_44'></a>the Alms Hall, one should say, 'Give me thy
heart,’ then, in truth, I will cut open my breast
with a spear, and, as though I were drawing
up a water-lily from a calm lake, I will pull
forth my heart. If he asks my flesh and blood,
behold I will give it to him. If he complain
that there is no other to do his work, then I
will leave my royal throne, and, proclaiming
myself a slave, I will do the work of a slave—and,
indeed, should any man ask for my eyes,
the most precious gift of the gods, then will I
tear them out as one might tear the pith from
the palm-tree.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then he bathed himself, and, mounted upon
a richly caparisoned elephant, he rode down
to the Alms Hall, his heart filled with love
for his people.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now Sakka, the King of the Gods, heard
the resolve of the King, and he thought to
test him, whether his words were vain; whether
it were a sudden mood which would pass away
when the moment came to carry out his stern
resolution.</p>

<p class='c005'>So, when the King came down to the Alms
Hall, Sakka stood before him, in the guise of
<a id='Page_45'></a>an old blind Brahmin, who, stretching out
his hands, cried out: “Long live the King!”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the King made sign for him to say
what was in his heart.</p>

<p class='c005'>“O great King,” said the blind Brahmin—“in
all the inhabited world there is no spot
where the fame of thy great heart has not
spread. I am blind, but thou, O King, hast
<i>two</i> eyes—I therefore beseech thee, give me
<i>one</i>, that I too may behold the glories of the
Earth!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then did the King rejoice greatly that this
opportunity should have come to him so
quickly, but not wishing to show at once the
joy he felt in his heart, he said: “O Brahmin,
I pray thee tell me, who bade thee wend thy
way to this alms-house? Thou askest of me
the most precious thing that a man possesses,
and lo! it is very hard to give!”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the Brahmin made answer: “Behold,
a god has sent me hither, and has told me to
ask this boon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the King said: “Thy prayer is granted:
thou didst ask for one eye, behold I will give
thee both eyes.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_46'></a>And then the news spread quickly through
the town that the King was about to give his
eyes to a blind Brahmin, and the Commander-in-Chief
and all the officials gathered together
that they might turn the King from his purpose.</p>

<p class='c005'>And they said: “O great King, are there
not other gifts which thou canst bestow upon
this sightless Brahmin—money, jewels, elephants
with cloth of gold? Why shouldst thou
give to him that most precious of gifts, thy
royal eyes?”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the King said: “Behold, I have taken
this vow, and I should be sinful if I were to
break it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the courtiers said: “O King, why doest
thou this thing? Is it for Life, or Beauty or
Strength?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The King answered: “It is for none of these
things: it is for the joy of giving.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the King bid the Surgeon do his work.
And when one of his eyes was taken out, he
gave it to the Brahmin, and it remained fixed
in his socket like a blue lotus flower in bloom.
And the King said: “The eye that sees all
<a id='Page_47'></a>things is greater than this eye,” and, being
filled with ecstasy of joy, he gave the second
eye.</p>

<p class='c005'>And after many days and much suffering,
the King’s sight was restored to him—not the
natural eyes which see the things around—but
the eyes which see perfect and absolute Truth.</p>

<p class='c005'>And he reigned in righteousness and justice,
and the people learnt of him pure wisdom.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_51'></a>
  <h2 id='chap08' class='c003'>THE BULL THAT DEMANDED FAIR TREATMENT</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Long ago the Bodisat came to life as a
Bull.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now, when he was yet a young calf, a certain
Brahmin, after attending upon some devotees
who were wont to give oxen to priests,
received the bull. And he called it Nandi
Visāla, and grew very fond of it, treating it
like a son, and feeding it on gruel and rice.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the Bodisat grew up, he said to himself:
“This Brahmin has brought me up with
great care; and there’s no other ox in all the
continent of India can drag the weight I can.
What if I were to let the Brahmin know about
my strength, and so in my turn provide sustenance
for him!”</p>

<p class='c005'>And he said one day to the Brahmin: “Do
you go now, Brahmin, to some Squire rich in
cattle, and offer to bet him a thousand that
your ox will move a hundred laden carts.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_52'></a>The Brahmin went to a rich farmer, and
started a conversation thus:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whose bullocks hereabout do you think
the strongest?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Such and such a man’s,” said the farmer,
and then added: “But, of course, there are
none in the whole country-side to touch my
own!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have one ox,” said the Brahmin, “who is
good to move a hundred carts, loads and all!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tush!” said the Squire. “Where in the
world is such an ox?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Just in my house!” said the Brahmin.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then make a bet about it!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“All right! I bet you a thousand he can.”</p>

<p class='c005'>So the bet was made. And he filled a hundred
carts (small wagons made for two bullocks)
with sand and gravel and stones, ranged
them all in a row, and tied them all firmly together,
cross-bar to axle-tree.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then he bathed Nandi Visāla, gave him a
measure of scented rice, hung a garland round
his neck, and yoked him by himself to the front
cart. Then he took his seat on the pole, raised
<a id='Page_53'></a>his goad aloft, and called out: “Gee up! you
brute!! Drag ’em along, you wretch!!”</p>

<p class='c005'>The Bodisat said to himself: “He addresses
me as a wretch. I am no wretch!” And, keeping
his four legs as firm as so many posts, he
stood perfectly still.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the Squire that moment claimed his
bet, and made the Brahmin hand over the thousand
pieces. And the Brahmin, minus his thousand,
took out his ox, went home to his house,
and lay down overwhelmed with grief.</p>

<p class='c005'>Presently Nandi Visāla, who was roaming
about the place, came up and saw the Brahmin
grieving there, and said to him: “What,
Brahmin! Are you asleep?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sleep! How can I sleep after losing the
thousand pieces?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Brahmin! I’ve lived so long in your house,
and have I ever broken any pots, or rubbed up
against the walls?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Never, my dear!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then why did you call me a wretch? It’s
your fault. It’s not my fault. Go now and
bet him two thousand; and never call me a
<a id='Page_54'></a>wretch again—I, who am no wretch at all!”</p>

<p class='c005'>When the Brahmin heard what he said, he
made the bet two thousand, tied the carts together
as before, decked out Nandi Visāla, and
yoked him to the foremost cart.</p>

<p class='c005'>He managed this in the following way: he
tied the pole and the cross-piece fast together,
yoked Nandi Visāla on one side; on the other
he fixed a smooth piece of timber from the
point of the yoke to the axle-end, and wrapping
it round with the fastenings of the cross-piece,
tied it fast, so that when this was done the yoke
could not move this way and that way, and it
was possible for one ox to drag forwards the
double bullock-cart.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the Brahmin seated himself on the
pole, stroked Nandi Visāla on the back, and
called out: “Gee up! my beauty!! Drag it
along, my beauty!!”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the Bodisat, with one mighty effort,
dragged forwards the hundred heavily-laden
carts, and brought the hindmost one up to the
place where the foremost one had stood.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the cattle-owner acknowledged himself
beaten, and handed over to the Brahmin
<a id='Page_55'></a>the two thousand; the bystanders, too, presented
the Bodisat with a large sum, and the
whole became the property of the Brahmin.
Thus, by means of the Bodisat, great was the
wealth he acquired.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_59'></a>
  <h2 id='chap09' class='c003'>THE BULL THAT PROVED HIS GRATITUDE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Long ago ... the Bodisat returned to
life as a Bull.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now, when it was still a young calf, its
owners stopped a while in an old woman’s
house, and gave him to her when they settled
their account for their lodging. And she
brought him up, treating him like a son, and
feeding him on gruel and rice.</p>

<p class='c005'>He soon became known as “The old woman’s
Blackie.” When he grew up, he roamed about,
as black as collyrium, with the village cattle,
and was very good-tempered and quiet. The
village children used to catch hold of his horns,
or ears, or dewlaps, and hang on to him; or
amuse themselves by pulling his tail, or riding
about on his back.</p>

<p class='c005'>One day he said to himself: “My mother
is wretchedly poor. She’s taken so much pains,
too, in bringing me up, and has treated me like
<a id='Page_60'></a>a son. What if I were to work for hire, and
so relieve her distress!” And from that day
he was always on the look-out for a job.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now, one day a young caravan owner arrived
at a neighboring ford with five hundred
bullock-wagons. And his bullocks were not
only unable to drag the carts across, but
even when he yoked the five hundred pair in
a row they could not move one cart by itself.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Bodisat was grazing with the village
cattle close to the ford. The young caravan
owner was a famous judge of cattle, and
began looking about to see whether there were
among them any thoroughbred bull able to
drag over the carts. Seeing the Bodisat, he
thought he would do, and asked the herdsmen:
“Who may be the owners, my men, of this
fellow? I should like to yoke him to the cart,
and am willing to give a reward for having the
carts dragged over.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Catch him and yoke him then,” said they.
“He has no owner hereabouts.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But when he began to put a string through
his nose and drag him along, he could not get
him to come. For the Bodisat, it is said,
<a id='Page_61'></a>wouldn’t go till he was promised a reward.</p>

<p class='c005'>The young caravan owner, seeing what his
object was, said to him: “Sir! if you’ll drag
over these five hundred carts for me, I’ll pay
you wages at the rate of two pence for each
cart—a thousand pieces in all.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the Bodisat went along of his own accord,
and the men yoked him to the cart. And
with a mighty effort he dragged it up and
landed it safe on the high ground. And in
the same manner he dragged up all the carts.</p>

<p class='c005'>So the caravan owner then put five hundred
pennies in a bundle, one for each cart, and tied
it round his neck. The Bull said to himself:
“This fellow is not giving me wages according
to the rate agreed upon. I shan’t let him go
on now!” And so he went and stood in the way
of the front cart, and they tried in vain to get
him away.</p>

<p class='c005'>The caravan owner thought: “He knows, I
suppose, that the pay is too little;” and wrapping
a thousand pieces in a cloth, tied them up
in a bundle, and hung that round his neck.
And as soon as he got the bundle with a thousand
inside, he went off to his “mother.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_62'></a>Then the village children called out: “See!
what’s that round the neck of the old woman’s
Blackie?” and began to run up to him. But
he chased after them, so that they took to their
heels before they got near him; and he went
straight to his “mother.” And he appeared
with eyes all bloodshot, utterly exhausted from
dragging over so many carts.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How did you get this, dear?” said the good
old woman, when she saw the bag round his
neck. And when she heard, on inquiry from
the herdsmen, what had happened, she exclaimed:
“Am I so anxious, then, to live on
the fruit of your toil, my darling! Why do you
put yourself to all this pain?”</p>

<p class='c005'>And she bathed him in warm water, and
rubbed him all over with oil, and gave him
to drink, and fed him up with good food. And
at the end of her life she passed away according
to her deeds, and the Bodisat with her.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_65'></a>
  <h2 id='chap10' class='c003'>THE HORSE THAT HELD OUT TO THE END</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>And it came to pass that the Buddha (to
be) came to life in the shape of a Horse—a
thoroughbred small horse, and he was
made the King’s Destrier, surrounded by
pomp and state. He was fed on exquisite
three-year-old rice which was always served up
to him in a golden dish worth a hundred thousand
pieces of money, and the ground of his
stall was perfumed with the four odors. Round
his stall were hung crimson curtains, while
overhead was a canopy studded with stars of
gold. On the wall were festooned wreaths and
garlands of fragrant flowers, and a lamp fed
with scented oil was always burning there.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now all the kings round coveted the kingdom
of Benares. Once seven kings passed
Benares and sent a missive to the King, saying:
“Either yield up your kingdom to us or give
battle.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_66'></a>Assembling his ministers, the King of
Benares laid the matter before them and asked
what he was to do. Said they: “You ought
not to go out to battle in person, Sire, in the
first instance. Despatch such and such a
Knight out first to fight him, and, later on,
if he fall, we will decide what to do.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the King sent for that Knight and said
to him: “Can you fight the seven kings, my
dear Knight?” Said he: “Give me but your
noble Destrier, and then I could fight not only
seven kings but all the kings in India.” “My
dear Knight, take my Destrier or any horse
you please, and do battle.” “Very good, my
Sovereign Lord,” said the Knight, and with
a bow he passed down from the upper chambers
of the palace.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then he had the noble Destrier led out and
sheathed in mail, arming himself too and girding
on his sword.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mounted on his noble steed he passed out
of the City Gate, and with a lightning charge
broke down the first camp, taking one king
alone, and bringing him back a prisoner to the
soldiers’ custody.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_67'></a>... And this went on until six kings had
been made prisoner. Then the noble Horse
received a wound which streamed with blood
and caused him much pain. Perceiving that
the Horse was wounded, the Knight made it
lie down at the King’s gate, loosened its mail,
and set about arming another horse.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the Horse perceiving this, said: “The
other horse will <i>not</i> be able to break down
the seventh camp and capture the seventh
king: he will lose all that I have accomplished.
The peerless Knight will be slain, and the
King will fall into the hands of the foe. I
alone and no other horse can break down
the seventh camp and capture the seventh
king.”</p>

<p class='c005'>So he called to the Knight and repeated
these words, and added: “I will not throw
away what I have already done. Only have
me set upon my feet, and clad again in my armor,
and I will accomplish my work.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The Knight had the Horse set upon his feet,
bound up his wound, and armed him again in
proof. Mounted on the Destrier, he broke
<a id='Page_68'></a>down the seventh camp, and brought back
alive the seventh king.</p>

<p class='c005'>They led the Horse to the King’s gate, and
the King came up to look at him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then said the Great Being: “Great King,
slay not these seven kings: bind them by an
oath, and let them go. Let the Knight enjoy
the honor due to us both. As for you, exercise
charity, keep the Ornaments, and rule your
kingdom in righteousness and justice.” When
the Horse had thus exhorted the King, they
took off his mail, but as they were taking it
off piecemeal, he passed away.</p>

<p class='c005'>The King had the body buried with due respect,
bestowed great honors on the Knight,
and sent the kings to their homes, after exacting
from each an oath never to war upon
him any more. And he ruled his kingdom in
righteousness and justice, passing away when
his life closed, to fare thereafter according to
his deserts.</p>

<p class='c005'>The story was told by the Master about a
brother who gave up persevering.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Brethren, in bygone days the wise and
good persevered even in hostile surroundings,
<a id='Page_69'></a>and even when they were wounded they did
not give in. Whereas you who have devoted
yourself to so saving a doctrine, how comes it

as the King of the monkeys. He lived
with his herd of 80,000 monkeys in a thick forest,
near a lake. In this lake there lived an
ogre who used to devour all those who went
down to the water.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Buddha spoke to his subjects and said:
“My friends, in this forest there are trees that
are poisoned, and lakes that are haunted by
ogres. Eat no fruit and drink no water of
which you have not already tasted without consulting
me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This they agreed to. And one day, having
arrived at a spot which they had never visited
before, they found a great lake. They did
not drink, but awaited the return of their
King.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now when he arrived he went round the
<a id='Page_74'></a>lake, and found that all the footsteps led down
to the lake, but none came up again. And
he said: “Without doubt this is the haunt of
an ogre.”</p>

<p class='c005'>When this water-ogre saw that they were
not invading his domain he appeared in the
form of a terrible monster with a blue belly,
a white face, and bright red hands and feet.
In this shape he came out of the water and
said to the King: “Why are you seated here?
Go down to the lake to drink.” But the King
said: “Are you not the ogre of this water?”
“Yes, I am,” was the answer. “Do you take
as your prey all those who go down into this
water?” “Yes, I do, from small birds upwards.
I never let anything go which comes
down into this water. I will eat the lot of you,
too.” “But we shall not let you eat us.” “Just
drink the water.” “Yes, we will drink the
water, and yet not fall into your power.”
“How do you propose to drink the water,
then?” “Ah, you think we shall have to go
down to the water to drink; whereas we shall
not enter the water at all, but the whole eighty
<a id='Page_75'></a>thousand of us will take a cane each and drink
therewith from your lake as easily as through
the hollow stalk of a lotus. And so you will
not be able to eat us.”</p>

<p class='c005'>So saying the King had a cane brought to
him, and in true belief that the miracle would
take place he blew down the cane, which
straightway became hollow throughout, without
a single knot being left in its length. In
this fashion he had another, and another
brought, and blew down them. Then he made
the tour of the lake, and commanded, saying,
“Let all canes growing here become hollow
throughout.” Now, thanks to the saving goodness
of their re-born chiefs, their commands
are always fulfilled. And henceforth every
single cane that grew round that lake became
hollow throughout. After giving his commands
the King seated himself with a cane in
his hand. All the other 80,000 monkeys, too,
seated themselves round the lake each with a
cane in his hands. At the same moment when
the King sucked up the water through his
cane, they all drank in the same manner as
<a id='Page_76'></a>they sat on the bank. This was the way they
drank, and the ogre could get no power over
any one of them, so he went off in a rage to
his habitation. The King, with his following
of 80,000 monkeys, went back into the forest.</p>

  <h2 id='chap12' class='c003'>THE MALLARD THAT ASKED FOR TOO MUCH</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>And it came to pass that the Buddha (to
be) was born a Brahmin, and growing
up was married to a bride of his own rank,
who bore him three daughters.</p>

<p class='c005'>After his death he was born again as a
Golden Mallard, and he determined to give his
golden feathers one at a time to enable his
wife and daughters to live in comfort. So
away he flew to where they dwelt, and alighted
on the central beam of the roof.</p>

<p class='c005'>Seeing the Bodisat, the wife and girls asked
where he had come from, and he told them
that he was their father who had died and been
born a Golden Mallard, and that he had come
to bring them help. “You shall have my golden
feathers, one by one,” he said. He gave
them one and departed. From time to time
he returned to give them another feather, and
they became quite wealthy.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_80'></a>But one day the mother said: “There’s no
trusting animals, my children. Who’s to say
your father might not go away one of these
days and never return? Let us use our time,
and pluck him clean the next time he comes,
so as to make sure of all his feathers.” Thinking
this would pain him, the daughters refused.
The mother in her greed plucked the Mallard
herself, and as she plucked them against his
wish, they ceased to be golden and became
like a crane’s feathers. His wings grew again,
but they were plain white; he flew away to his
own abode and never came back.</p>

  <a id='Page_83'></a>
  <h2 id='chap13' class='c003'>THE MERCHANT WHO OVERCAME ALL OBSTACLES</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Once upon a time the Buddha (to be)
was born in a merchant’s family; and
when he grew up he went about trafficking
with five hundred carts.</p>

<p class='c005'>One day he arrived at a sandy desert twenty
leagues across. The sand in that desert was
so fine that when taken in the closed fist it
could not be kept in the hand. After the sun
had risen it became as hot as a mass of charcoal,
so that no man could walk on it. Those,
therefore, who had to travel over it took wood
and water and oil and rice in their carts, and
traveled during the night. And at daybreak
they formed an encampment, and spread an
awning over it, and, taking their meals early,
they passed the day sitting in the shade. At
sunset they supped; and when the ground had
become cool, they yoked their oxen and went
on. The traveling was like a voyage over the
<a id='Page_84'></a>sea: a so-called land-pilot had to be chosen,
and he brought the caravan safe to the other
side by his knowledge of the stars.</p>

<p class='c005'>On this occasion the merchant of our story
traversed the desert in that way. And when
he had passed over fifty-nine leagues, he
thought: “Now in one more night we shall get
out of the sand.” And after supper he directed
the wood and water to be thrown away, and
the wagons to be yoked, and so set out. The
pilot had cushions arranged on the foremost
cart, and lay down looking at the stars, and
directing them where to drive. But, worn out
by want of rest during the long march, he fell
asleep, and did not perceive that the oxen had
turned around and taken the same road by
which they had come.</p>

<p class='c005'>The oxen went on the whole night through.
Towards dawn the pilot woke up, and, observing
the stars, called out: “Stop the wagons!
Stop the wagons!” The day broke just as they
had stopped, and were drawing up the carts in
a line. Then the men cried out: “Why, this is
the very encampment we left yesterday! Our
wood and water is all gone! We are lost!”
<a id='Page_85'></a>And unyoking the oxen, and spreading the
canopy over their heads, they lay down in despondency,
each one under his wagon.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the Bodisat, saying to himself, “If I
lose heart, all these will perish,” walked about
while the morning was yet cool. And on seeing
a tuft of Kusa grass, he thought: “This
must have grown by attracting some water
which there must be beneath it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And he made them bring a hoe and dig in
that spot. And they dug sixty cubits deep.
And when they had got thus far, the spade of
the diggers struck on a rock, and as soon as it
struck, they all gave up in despair.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the Bodisat thought, “There must be
water under that rock,” and, stooping down,
applied his ear to it and tested the sound of
it. And he heard the sound of water gurgling
beneath. And he got out and called his page.
“My lad, if you give up now, we shall all be
lost. Don’t you lose heart. Take this iron
hammer, and go down into the pit and give
the rock a good blow.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The lad obeyed, and though they all stood
by in despair, he went down full of determination,
<a id='Page_86'></a>and struck at the stone. And the rock
split in two and fell below, and no longer
blocked up the stream. And water rose till
its brim was the height of a palm-tree in the
well. And they all drank of the water, and
bathed in it. Then they split up their extra
yokes and axles, and cooked rice and ate it,
and fed their oxen with it. And when the sun
set, they put up a flag by the well and went
to the place appointed. There they sold their
merchandise at double and treble profit, and
returned to their own home, and lived to a
good old age, and then passed away according
to their deeds. And the Bodisat gave gifts,
and did other virtuous acts, and passed away
according to his deeds.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_89'></a>
  <h2 id='chap14' class='c003'>THE ELEPHANT THAT WAS HONORED IN OLD AGE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>And the Buddha as Prime Minister served
the King. Now there was a certain She-Elephant
endowed with great might which
enabled her to go a hundred leagues a day.
She did the duties of messenger to the King,
and in battle she fought and crushed the
enemy. The King said: “She is very serviceable
to me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He gave her ornaments, and caused all
honor to be shown her. Then, when she was
weak from age, the King took away all the
honor he had bestowed.</p>

<p class='c005'>From that time she was unprotected, and
lived by eating grass and leaves in the forest.</p>

<p class='c005'>And one day the chief Potter had not
enough oxen to yoke to the carts which carried
the material for making clay. And the
King said: “Where is our She-Elephant?”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_90'></a>“O King! she is wandering at her will in
the forest.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the King said: “Do thou yoke her to
the cart.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the Potter said: “Good, O King!”
And he did even as the King commanded.</p>

<p class='c005'>But when this insult was offered to the
Elephant, she came to the Prime Minister
and said: “O Wise Being! I pray you listen
to my tale. When I was young, great strength
was mine; and I did walk a hundred leagues
to bear the King’s messages, and, with weapons
bound upon my body, I did take part in
battle, crushing the enemy beneath my feet.
And now I am old, and the King hath withdrawn
all the honors he bestowed upon me,
and not content with allowing me to wander
and feed on grass, unprotected in my old age,
he has <i>even caused me to be yoked to</i> the
Potter’s cart as are the oxen.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the Buddha promised that he would
plead her cause, and appearing before the
King, he asked: “Great King, did not a She-Elephant
covered with weapons do battle for
thee; and on such and such a day, with a
<a id='Page_91'></a>writing upon her neck, did she not go a
hundred leagues on a message? Thou didst
bestow upon her great honor. I pray thee
tell me, where is she now?”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the King, in some confusion, made
answer: “Behold, she is yoked to a cart.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then did the Buddha speak in sorrowful
anger to the King, and rebuked him, saying:
“Thou hast yoked this Elephant to a cart after
all the services she has rendered. Then was
the honor only bestowed because of more
services expected?”</p>

<p class='c005'>And all who heard him received his instruction,
and the King restored the She-Elephant
to her former place of honor.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_95'></a>
  <h2 id='chap15' class='c003'>THE FAITHFUL FRIEND</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Long ago, when Brahma-datta was reigning
in Benares, the Bodisat became his
Minister.</p>

<p class='c005'>At that time a dog used to go to the
state elephant’s stable, and feed on the lumps
of rice which fell where the elephant fed.
Being attracted there by the food, he soon
became great friends with the elephant, and
used to eat close by him. At last neither of
them was happy without the other; and the
dog used to amuse himself by catching hold
of the elephant’s trunk, and swinging to
and fro.</p>

<p class='c005'>But one day there came a peasant who gave
the elephant-keeper money for the dog, and
took it back with him to his village. From
that time the elephant, missing the dog, would
neither eat nor drink nor bathe. And they
let the King know about it.</p>

<p class='c005'>He sent the Bodisat, saying: “Do you go,
<a id='Page_96'></a>Pandit, and find out what’s the cause of the
elephant’s behavior.”</p>

<p class='c005'>So he went to the stable, and seeing how
sad the elephant looked, said to himself:
“There seems to be nothing bodily the matter
with him. He must be so overwhelmed with
grief by missing some one, I should think, who
had become near and dear to him.” And he
asked the elephant-keepers: “Is there any one
with whom he is particularly intimate?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Certainly, Sir! There was a dog of whom
he was very fond indeed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where is it now?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Some man or other took it away.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you know where the man lives?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, Sir!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the Bodisat went and told the King.
“There’s nothing the matter with the elephant,
your majesty; but he was great friends with
a dog, and I fancy it’s through missing it that
he refuses his food.”</p>

<p class='c005'>When the King heard what he said, he
asked what was now to be done.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Have a proclamation made, O King, to
this effect: 'A man is said to have taken away
<a id='Page_97'></a>a dog of whom our state elephant was fond.
In whose house soever that dog shall be
found, he shall be fined so much!’”</p>

<p class='c005'>The King did so; and, as soon as he heard
of it, the man turned the dog loose. The dog
hastened back, and went close up to the elephant.
The elephant took him up in his trunk
and placed him on his forehead, and wept and
cried, and took him down again, and watched
him as he fed. And then he took his own food.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the King paid great honor to the
Bodisat for knowing the motives even of
animals.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_101'></a>
  <h2 id='chap16' class='c003'>THE HAWK AND THE OSPREY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>There lived once, on the shores of a
natural lake, a Hawk on the south shore,
a She-Hawk on the west shore, on the north
a Lion, the king of beasts, on the east the
Osprey, the king of birds, in the middle a
Tortoise on a small island.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now the Hawk asked the She-Hawk to
become his wife. She asked him: “Have you
any friends?” “No, madam,” he replied. “But,”
she said, “we must have some friends who
can defend us against any danger or trouble
that may arise. Therefore I beg of you to
find some friends.” “But,” said the Hawk,
“with whom shall I make friends?” “Why,
with King Osprey, who lives on the eastern
shore, with King Lion on the north, and with
the Tortoise who lives in the middle of the
lake.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And he took her advice. And all these
creatures formed a bond of friendship, and
<a id='Page_102'></a>promised to protect each other in time of
danger.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now in time the Mother-Hawk had two
sons. One day when the wings of the young
birds were not yet callow, some of the country-folk
went foraging through the woods all day
and found nothing.</p>

<p class='c005'>They went down to the lake to catch fish
or a tortoise, and, in order to drive away the
gnats, they made a fire by rubbing sticks
together. The smoke annoyed the young
birds, and they uttered a cry. The men said:
“’Tis the cry of birds—we will make a fire
and eat their flesh.” They made the fire blaze
and built it up.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the Mother-Bird heard the sound, and
thought: “These men will eat our young ones.
I will send my mate to the Great Osprey.”
This she did, and the bird promised to help.
He sat upon a tree-top near that in which the
Hawks had built their nests, and no sooner
did the men begin to climb up the tree than
the Osprey dived into the lake, and from
wings and back sprinkled water upon the
<a id='Page_103'></a>brands and put the fire out. Down came the
men and made another fire, but again the
Osprey put it out, and this went on until
midnight.</p>

<p class='c005'>And the bird was tired out and his eyes
were bloodshot. And the Mother-Bird
whispered to her mate: “My Lord, the Osprey
is worn out! Go and tell the Tortoise, that
this weary bird may have a rest.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But the Osprey in a loud voice said he
would gladly give his life to guard the tree.
And the grateful Hawk said: “I pray thee,
friend Osprey, rest awhile.” Then he went
for help to the Tortoise, who said he would
gladly help, but his son said: “I would not
have my old father troubled, but I will gladly
go in his stead.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the Tortoise collected mud and
quenched the flame. Then said the men: “Let
us kill the Tortoise: he will be enough for
all.” But when they plucked creepers to bind
him and tried to turn him over, he dragged
them into the water. And they said: “What
strange things have happened to us! Half
<a id='Page_104'></a>the night the Osprey has put out our fire, and
now the Tortoise has dragged us in after him
and made us swallow water. Let us light
another fire, and at sunrise we will eat these
young Hawks.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The Hen-Bird heard the noise and said:
“My husband—sooner or later these men will
devour our young and depart. You go and
tell our friend the Lion.” At once the Hawk
went to the Lion, who asked him why he came
at such an unreasonable hour. But when the
whole matter was put before him, he said:
“Go and comfort your young ones, for I will
save them.” And then he came forth with
a mighty tread, and the men were terrified.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Alas!” they cried. “The Osprey hath put
out our fire. The Tortoise dragged us into the
water. But now we are done for: the Lion
will destroy us at once.” They ran this way
and that, and when the noble beast stood at
the foot of the tree, no trace could be found
of the frightened men.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the Osprey, the Hawk, the She-Hawk,
and the Tortoise came up to greet
him, and they discoursed for a long time on
<a id='Page_105'></a>the value of friendship. And this company
of friends lived all their lives without breaking
their bond. And they passed away according
to their deeds.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_109'></a>
  <h2 id='chap17' class='c003'>GRANDMOTHER’S GOLDEN DISH</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Long ago the Bodisat was a dealer in
tin and brass ware, named Seriva, in
the country of that name. This Seriva, together
with another dealer in tin and brass
ware, who was an avaricious man, crossed the
river Tēlavāha, and entered the town called
Andhapura. And, dividing the streets of the
city between them, the Bodisat went round
selling his goods in the street allotted to him,
while the other took the street that fell to him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now in that city there was a wealthy family
reduced to abject poverty. All the sons and
brothers in the family had died, and all its
property had been lost. Only one girl and
her grandmother were left; and those two
gained their living by serving others for hire.
There was indeed in the house the vessel of
gold out of which the head of the house used
to eat in the days of its prosperity; but it
was covered with dirt, and had long lain
<a id='Page_110'></a>neglected and unused among the pots and
pans. And they did not even know that it
was of gold.</p>

<p class='c005'>At that time the avaricious hawker, as he
was going along, calling out, “Buy my water-pots!
Buy my water-pots!” came to the door
of their house. When the girl saw him, she
said to her grandmother: “Mother! do buy me
an ornament.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But we are poor, dear. What shall we
give in exchange for it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“This dish of ours is no use to us; you can
give that away and get one.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The old woman called the hawker, and,
after asking him to take a seat, gave him
the dish, and said: “Will you take this, Sir,
and give something to your little sister for it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The hawker took the dish, and thought:
“This must be gold!” And turning it round,
he scratched a line on its back with a needle,
and found that it was so. Then, hoping to
get the dish without giving them anything,
he said: “What is this worth? It is not even
worth a halfpenny!” And throwing it on the
<a id='Page_111'></a>ground, he got up from his seat and went
away.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now, it was allowed to either hawker to
enter the street which the other had left. And
the Bodisat came into that street, and calling
out, “Buy my water-pots,” came up to the
door of that very house. And the girl spoke
to her grandmother as before. But the grandmother
said: “My child, the dealer who came
just now threw the dish on the floor, and went
away; what have I now got to give him in
exchange?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That merchant, mother dear, was a surly
man; but this one looks pleasant, and has a
kind voice: perchance he may take it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Call him, then,” said she.</p>

<p class='c005'>So she called him. And when he had come
in and sat down, they gave him the dish. He
saw that it was gold, and said: “Mother! this
dish is worth a hundred thousand. All the
goods in my possession are not equal to it in
value!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, Sir, a hawker who came just now
threw it on the ground, and went away, saying
<a id='Page_112'></a>it was not worth a halfpenny. It must
have been changed into gold by the power of
your virtue, so we make you a present of it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The Bodisat gave them all the cash he had
in hand (five hundred pieces), and all his
stock-in-trade, worth five hundred more. He
asked of them only to let him keep eight pennies,
and the bag and the yoke that he used to
carry his things with. And these he took and
departed.</p>

<p class='c005'>And going quickly to the river-side, he gave
those eight pennies to a boatman, and got
into the boat.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the covetous hawker came back to the
house, and said: “Bring out that dish, I’ll give
you something for it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then she scolded him, and said: “You said
our gold dish, worth a hundred thousand, was
not worth a halfpenny. But a just dealer,
who seems to be your master, gave us a thousand
for it, and has taken it away.”</p>

<p class='c005'>When he heard this he called out:
“Through this fellow I have lost a golden
pot worth—Oh, worth a hundred thousand!
He has ruined me altogether!” And bitter
<a id='Page_113'></a>sorrow overcame him, and he was unable to
retain his presence of mind, and he lost all
self command. And scattering the money he
had, and all the goods, at the door of the house,
he seized as a club the yoke by which he had
carried them, and tore off his clothes, and
pursued after the Bodisat.</p>

<p class='c005'>When he reached the river-side, he saw the
Bodisat going away, and he cried out: “Hallo,
Boatman! stop the boat!”</p>

<p class='c005'>But the Bodisat said: “Don’t stop!” and so
prevented that. And as the other gazed and
gazed at the departing Bodisat, he was torn
with violent grief; his heart grew hot, and
blood flowed from his mouth until his heart
broke—like tank-mud in the heat of the sun.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus harboring hatred against the Bodisat,
he brought about on that very spot his own
destruction. This was the first time that
Devadatta harbored hatred against the
Bodisat.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the Bodisat gave gifts, and did other
good acts, and passed away according to his
deeds.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_117'></a>
  <h2 id='chap18' class='c003'>THE ELEPHANT THAT SPARED LIFE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>At that time the Bodisat was born as a
nobleman’s son. On the naming-day
they gave him the name of Prince Magha, and
when he grew up he was known as “Magha
the young Brahmin.”</p>

<p class='c005'>His parents procured him a wife from a
family of equal rank; and, increasing in sons
and daughters, he became a great giver of
gifts, and kept the Five Commandments.</p>

<p class='c005'>In that village there were as many as thirty
families; and one day the men of those
families stopped in the middle of the village
to transact some village business. The Bodisat
removed with his feet the lumps of soil on
the place where he stood, and made the spot
convenient to stand on; but another came up
and stood there. Then he smoothed out another
spot, and took his stand there; but another
man came and stood upon it. Still the
<a id='Page_118'></a>Bodisat tried again and again, with the same
result, until he had made convenient standing-room
for all the thirty.</p>

<p class='c005'>The next time he had an open-roofed shed
put up there; and then pulled that down, and
built a hall, and had benches spread in it, and
a water-pot placed there. On another occasion
those thirty men were reconciled by the
Bodisat, who confirmed them in the Five
Commandments; and thenceforward he continued
with them in works of piety.</p>

<p class='c005'>Whilst they were so living they used to
rise up early, go out with bill-hooks and crowbars
in their hands, tear up with the crowbars
the stones in the four high roads and village
paths, and roll them away, take away the
trees which would be in the way of vehicles,
make the rough places plain, form causeways,
dig ponds, build public halls, give gifts, and
keep the Commandments—thus, in many
ways, all the dwellers in the village listened to
the exhortations of the Bodisat, and kept the
Commandments.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now the village headman said to himself:
<a id='Page_119'></a>“I used to have great gain from fines, and
taxes, and pot-money, when these fellows
drank strong drink, or took life, or broke the
other Commandments. But now Magha the
young Brahmin has determined to have the
Commandments kept, and permits none to
take life, or to do anything else that is wrong.
I’ll make them keep the Commandments with
a vengeance!”</p>

<p class='c005'>And he went in a rage to the King, and
said: “O King! there are a number of robbers
going about sacking the villages!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Go and bring them up!” said the King
in reply.</p>

<p class='c005'>And he went, and brought back all those
men as prisoners, and had it announced to
the King that the robbers were brought up.
And the King, without inquiring what they
had done, gave orders to have them all trampled
to death by elephants!</p>

<p class='c005'>Then they made them all lie down in the
courtyard, and fetched the elephant. And the
Bodisat exhorted them, saying: “Keep the
Commandments in mind. Regard them all—the
<a id='Page_120'></a>slanderer, and the King, and the elephant—with
feelings as kind as you harbor towards
yourselves!”</p>

<p class='c005'>And they did so.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then men led up the elephant; but though
they brought him to the spot, he would not
begin his work, but trumpeted forth a mighty
cry, and took to flight. And they brought up
another and another, but they all ran away.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There must be some drug in their possession,”
said the King; and gave orders to have
them searched. So they searched, but found
nothing, and told the King so.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then they must be repeating some spell.
Ask them if they have any spell to utter.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The officials asked them, and the Bodisat
said there was. And they told the King, and
he had them all called before him, and said:
“Tell me that spell you know!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the Bodisat spoke, and said: “O King!
we have no other spell but this—that we destroy
no life, not even of grass; that we take
nothing which is not given to us; that we are
never guilty of unfaithfulness, nor speak
falsehood, nor drink intoxicants; that we exercise
<a id='Page_121'></a>ourselves in love, and give gifts; that
we make rough places plain, dig ponds, and
put up rest-houses—this is our spell, this is
our defense, this is our strength!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the King had confidence in them, and
gave them all the property in the house of
the slanderer, and made him their slave; and
bestowed, too, the elephant upon them, and
made them a grant of the village.</p>

  <h2 id='chap19' class='c003'>HOW THE ANTELOPE WAS CAUGHT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Once upon a time the King of Benares
had a gardener named Sanjaya. Now,
a swift antelope who had come to the garden
took to flight as soon as it saw Sanjaya. But
Sanjaya did not frighten it away; and when
it had come again and again it began to walk
about in the garden. And day by day the
gardener used to pluck the various fruits and
flowers in the garden and take them away to
the King.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now, one day the King asked him: “I say,
friend gardener, is there anything strange in
the garden so far as you’ve noticed?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ve noticed nothing, O King, save that an
antelope is in the habit of coming and wandering
about there. That I often see.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But could you catch it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If I had a little honey I could bring it
right inside the palace here!”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_126'></a>The King gave him the honey; and he took
it, went to the garden, smeared it on the grass
at the spot the antelope frequented, and hid
himself. When the deer came and had eaten
the honey-smeared grass, it was bound with
the lust of taste; and from that time went
nowhere else, but came exclusively to the
garden. And as the gardener saw that it was
allured by the honey-smeared grass, he in due
course showed himself. For a few days the
antelope took to flight on seeing him. But
after seeing him again and again it acquired
confidence, and gradually came to eat grass
from the gardener’s hand. And when the
gardener saw that its confidence was gained,
he strewed the path right up to the palace as
thick with branches as if he were covering it
with mats, hung a gourdful of honey over his
shoulder, carried a bundle of grass at his waist,
and then kept sprinkling honey-smeared grass
in front of the antelope till he led him within
the palace.</p>

<p class='c005'>As soon as the deer had got inside, they
shut the door. The antelope, seeing men,
began to tremble and quake with the fear of
<a id='Page_127'></a>death, and ran hither and thither about the
hall. The King came down from his upper
chamber, and, seeing the trembling creature,
said: “Such is the nature of an antelope, that
it will not go for a week afterwards to a place
where it has seen men, nor its life long to a
place where it has been frightened. Yet this
one, with just such a disposition, and accustomed
only to the jungle, has now, bound by
the lust of taste, come to just such a place.
Verily, there is nothing worse in the world than
this lust of taste!”</p>

<p class='c005'>And when in other words he had shown
the danger of greed, he let the antelope go
back to the forest.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_131'></a>
  <h2 id='chap20' class='c003'>THE BANYAN DEER</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Long ago the Bodisat came to life as a
deer. When he was born he was of a
golden color; his eyes were like round jewels;
his horns were white as silver; his mouth was
red as a cluster of kamala flowers; his hoofs
were as bright and hard as lacquer-work; his
tail as fine as the tail of a Thibetan ox; and
his body as large in size as a foal’s.</p>

<p class='c005'>He lived in the forest with an attendant
herd of five hundred deer, under the name of
the King of the Banyan Deer; and not far
from him there dwelt another deer, golden as
he, under the name of the Monkey Deer, with
a like attendant herd.</p>

<p class='c005'>The King of that country was devoted to
hunting, never ate without meat, and used to
summon all the townspeople to go hunting
every day to the destruction of their ordinary
work. The people thought, “This King puts
an end to all our work. Suppose we make a
<a id='Page_132'></a>park, provide food and drink for the deer.
Then we will drive them into the park, close
the entrance and deliver them to the King.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This they did, surrounding the very place
where the Banyan Deer and the Monkey Deer
were living. When the King heard this, he
went to the park, and seeing there the two
golden-colored deer, he granted them their
lives. But henceforth he would go himself to
shoot the deer and bring it home. Sometimes
his cook would go and shoot one. The deer,
as soon as they saw the bow, would quake with
fear of Death, and run away; but when they
had been hit once or twice, they became weary
or wounded and were killed. And the herd
told their King, who sent for the Monkey
Deer and said: “Friend, almost all the Deer
are being destroyed. Now, though they certainly
must die, yet henceforth let them not
be wounded with arrows. Let the deer take
it by turns to go to the place of execution.
One day let the lot fall on my herd, and the
next day on yours.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He agreed, and thenceforth the deer whose
turn it was used to go down and lie down after
<a id='Page_133'></a>placing his neck on the block of execution.
And the cook used to come and carry off the
one he found lying there.</p>

<p class='c005'>But one day the lot fell upon a roe in the
Monkey Deer who was with young. She went
to the Monkey Deer and said: “Lord! I am
with young. When I have brought forth my
son, we will both take our turn. Order the
bows to pass me by.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I cannot make your lot,” said he, “fall
upon the others. You know well enough it
has fallen upon you. Go away!” Receiving
no help from him, she went to the Bodisat
and told him the matter. He listened to her
quietly and said: “Be it so! Do you go back.
I will relieve you of your turn.” And he went
himself and laid his head on the block of
execution.</p>

<p class='c005'>The cook, seeing him, exclaimed: “The
King of the Deer whose life was promised to
him is lying in the place of execution. What
does it mean?” And he went hastily, and told
the King.</p>

<p class='c005'>The King no sooner heard it than he
mounted his chariot and proceeded with a
<a id='Page_134'></a>great retinue to the place, and beholding the
Bodisat, said: “My friend, the King of the
Deer! Did I not grant you your life? Why
are you lying here?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“O great King! A roe with young came and
told me that the lot had fallen upon her. Now
I could not ask another to take her place, so
I, giving my life for her, have lain down.
Harbor no further suspicion, O great King!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My Lord, the golden-colored King of
the Deer! I never yet saw, even among men,
one so full of forbearance, kindness and compassion.
I am pleased with thee in this matter!
Rise up. I grant your lives, both to you and
to her!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But though we be safe, what shall the
rest do, O King of men?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then I grant their lives to the rest, my
Lord.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thus, then, great King, the deer in the
park will have gained security, but what will
the others do?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“They also shall not be molested.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Great King! even though the deer dwell
<a id='Page_135'></a>secure, what shall the rest of the four-footed
creatures do?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“They shall also be free from fear.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Great King, even though the quadrupeds
are in safety, what shall the flock of birds do?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, I grant the same boon to them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Great King! the birds then will obtain
peace; but what of the fish who dwell in the
water?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“They shall have peace as well.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the Great Being having interceded
with the King for all creatures, said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Walk in righteousness, O great King!
Doing justice to fathers and mothers, to
townsmen and landsmen, you shall enter, when
your body is dissolved, the happy world of
Heaven.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c005'>The roe gave birth to a son as beautiful as
buds of flowers; and he went to playing about
with the Monkey Deer’s herd. But when its
mother saw that, she said, “My son, henceforth
go not in his company. You may keep
to the Banyan Deer’s herd.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_136'></a>Now after that, the deer, secure of their
lives, began to eat men’s crops. And the men
dared not strike them or drive them away,
recollecting how it had been granted to them
that they should dwell secure. So they met
together in front of the King’s palace, and
told the matter to the King.</p>

<p class='c005'>“When I was well pleased, I granted to the
leader of the Banyan herd a boon,” said he.
“I may give up my kingdom but not my oaths!
Begone with you! Not a man in my kingdom
shall be allowed to hurt the deer.”</p>

<p class='c005'>When the Banyan King heard that, he assembled
his herd, and said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Henceforth you are not allowed to eat
other people’s crops.” And so forbidding
them, he sent a message to the men: “Henceforth
let the husbandmen put up no fence to
guard their crops: but let them tie leaves
round the edge of the field as a sign.”</p>

<p class='c005'>From that time, they say, the sign of the
tying of the leaves was seen in the fields, and
from that time not a single deer trespassed
beyond it: for such was the instruction they
<a id='Page_137'></a>received from (their King) the Bodisat.</p>

<p class='c005'>And the Bodisat continued thus his life long
to instruct the deer, and passed away with
his herd, according to his deeds.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_141'></a>
  <h2 id='chap21' class='c003'>THE PUPIL WHO TAUGHT HIS TEACHER</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>And the Buddha was re-born in a Brahmin
family and was known as Dhamapala
or Law Keeper.</p>

<p class='c005'>When he came of age he was sent by his
father to study with a world famed teacher
at Takasila and became the chief pupil in a
company of five hundred youths.</p>

<p class='c005'>At that time the eldest son of the teacher
died and the father, surrounded by his pupils,
in the midst of his kith and kin, buried his son—and
all the pupils wept and wailed, but
Dhamapala was silent and shed no tear, but
when the company returned from the cemetery
Dhamapala asked, “Why did your son die?
It is not right that children should die; only
when people grow old can this happen.” And
they asked him, “Is it the custom of your
family that the young do not die?” And he
said: “Yes, that is the custom in my family.”
<a id='Page_142'></a>The lads told this conversation to their teacher.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now when the teacher heard this, he said
to them, “That is a most marvelous thing that
he says. I will make a journey to his father
and ask him about it, and if it be true I will
live according to his rule of right.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And he said to the young man: “I am going
on a journey. Do thou, in my absence, instruct
these youths.”</p>

<p class='c005'>So saying, he procured the bones of a wild
goat, washed and scented them, and put them
into a bag. Then taking with him a little page
boy he started for the village in which lived
the father of his pupil.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the house was reached, and the
teacher had rested and taken food, and the
host had washed the feet of his guest, the
teacher said: “Brahmin, your son when full
of wisdom has by an unhappy chance lost his
life. Grieve not for him.” The Brahmin
laughed loudly. “Why do you laugh, Brahmin?”
asked the other. “Because,” he said,
“it is <i>not</i> my son who is dead; it must be some
other.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, Brahmin, your son is dead, and no
<a id='Page_143'></a>other. Look on his bones, and believe.” So
saying, he unwrapped the bones. “There are
your son’s bones,” he said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A wild goat’s bones, perhaps,” quoth the
Brahmin, “or a dog’s, but my son is not dead.
In our family for seven generations, no such
thing has been known as a death in tender
years, and you are speaking falsehood.” Then
they all clapped their hands and laughed aloud.</p>

<p class='c005'>The teacher, when he beheld this wonderful
thing, was much pleased and said: “Brahmin,
this custom in your family line cannot be without
cause, that the young do not die. Why <i>is</i>
it that you do not die young? Of what good
and holy deed is this the fruit?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the Brahmin made answer:</p>

<p class='c005'>“We walk in righteousness. We speak no
ill. We flee from things that are evil. We
take no heed of the foolish. We follow the
counsel of the wise. We delight in giving
gifts. We feed the hungry. We are faithful
in our marriage vows. We are versed in
sacred knowledge. Therefore, the young
amongst us never die.”</p>

<p class='c005'>On hearing this, the teacher replied: “A
<a id='Page_144'></a>happy journey is this of mine and fruitful. I
came hither, O wise Brahmin, to test you.
Your son is safe and well. I pray you impart
to me your rule of preserving life.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the other wrote it on a leaf and returned
to his pupils.</p>

  <h2 id='chap22' class='c003'>THE MAN WHO TOLD A LIE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>On one occasion four divine beings made
their appearance on the Earth to attend
a festival of the Gods.</p>

<p class='c005'>And they bore in their hands wreaths of
the strangest flowers that had ever been seen,
and those around asked: “What are these
flowers?” And the Gods made answer and
said: “These divine flowers are fit for those
possessed of great powers: for the base, the
foolish, the faithless, the sinful beings within
the world of men, they are <i>not</i> fitted. But,
whosoever amongst men is endowed with
certain virtues—to them is due the honor of
wearing these flowers.</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“He who steals no thing from another,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who uttereth no lie,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who doth not lose his head at the height of Fame—</div>
      <div class='line'>He may wear the flowers.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><a id='Page_148'></a>Now there was a certain false Teacher or
Priest who thought to himself: “I do not
possess one of these qualities, but, by appearing
to possess them, I shall obtain permission
to wear the wreaths, and the people will
believe that I really am what I appear to be,
and they will place their confidence in me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then, with exceeding boldness, he came to
the first of the Gods and exclaimed with great
solemnity: “Behold, <i>I</i> am endowed with these
qualities of which you speak—</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have stolen from no man, never have I
uttered a lie, nor has fame ever caused me to
be proud or haughty.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And when he had uttered these words, the
wreath was placed upon his brow. And, emboldened
by his success, he came with the same
pride and confidence into the presence of the
second God, and asked that the second wreath
should be bestowed upon him.</p>

<p class='c005'>And the God said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“He who earns wealth honestly, and shuns dishonest means,</div>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_149'></a>Who takes but sparingly of the Cup of Pleasure,</div>
      <div class='line'>To him shall be awarded this second wreath.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>And the false Priest bowed his head and
said: “Behold all that I have earned is
honestly gotten, and all pleasure have I
shunned. Give me the wreath!”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the wreath was placed upon his
brow.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then, with boldness increased by his
success, he approached the third God, and
asked that the third wreath should encircle
his brow.</p>

<p class='c005'>And the God said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“He who scorns choice food,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who never turneth from his purpose,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who keepeth his faith unchanged,</div>
      <div class='line'>To him shall be given the wreath.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>And the false Priest said: “I have ever lived
on the simplest fare. I have been ever steadfast
<a id='Page_150'></a>of purpose, and loyal in my faith. Therefore
give <i>me</i> the wreath.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the third wreath was bestowed upon
him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then did the pride of the false Priest know
no bounds, and he went hastily to the fourth
God and demanded the fourth wreath.</p>

<p class='c005'>And the God said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“He who will attack no good man to his face or behind his back,</div>
      <div class='line'>And who keeps his word in all things,</div>
      <div class='line'>To him belongs this wreath.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Then the false Priest cried out in a loud
voice: “I have attacked no man, good or evil,
and never have I broken my word to any.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The God looked at him sadly, but he placed
the wreath upon his brow, and the four divine
beings disappeared from the sight of man. But
no sooner had they left the earth than the
Priest felt a violent pain. His head seemed to
be crushed by spikes, and, writhing in agony,
he made full confession and begged that the
flowers should be removed from his head; but
<a id='Page_151'></a>though all pitied his condition, none could remove
the flowers, for they seemed to be fastened
on with an iron band.</p>

<p class='c005'>And he called aloud to the Gods, saying</p>

<p class='c005'>“O ye great powers, forgive my pride and
spare my life!” And they answered: “These
flowers are not meet for the wicked. You have
received the reward of your false words.”
Then, having rebuked him in the presence of
the people, they removed the flowers from the
head of the repentant man and returned to
the abode of the Blest.</p>

  <a id='Page_155'></a>
  <h2 id='chap23' class='c003'>THE CROW THAT THOUGHT IT KNEW</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Once upon a time, while Brahma-datta
reigned as king in Benares, the Bodhisatta
became a marsh crow, and dwelt by a
certain pool. His name was Viraka, the
Strong.</p>

<p class='c005'>There arose a famine in Kasi. Men could
not spare food for the crows, nor make offering
to goblins and snakes. One by one the
crows left the famine-stricken land, and betook
them to the woods.</p>

<p class='c005'>A certain crow named Savitthaka, who
lived at Benares, took with him his lady crow
and went to the place where Viraka lived,
making his abode beside the same pool.</p>

<p class='c005'>One day, this crow was seeking food about
the pool. He saw how Viraka went down into
it, and made a meal off some fish; and afterwards
came up out of the water again, and
stood drying his feathers. “Under the wing
<a id='Page_156'></a>of that crow,” thought he, “plenty of fish are
to be got. I will become his servant.” So he
drew near.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is it, Sir?” asked Viraka.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I want to be your servant, my Lord!” was
the reply.</p>

<p class='c005'>Viraka agreed, and from that time the other
served him. And from that time, Viraka used
to eat enough fish to keep him alive, and the
rest he gave to Savitthaka as soon as he had
caught them; and when Savitthaka had eaten
enough to keep him alive, he gave what was
over to his wife.</p>

<p class='c005'>After a while pride came into his heart.
“This crow,” said he, “is black, and so am I:
in eyes and beak and feet, too, there is no
difference between us. I don’t want his fish;
I will catch my own!” So he told Viraka that
for the future he intended to go down to the
water and catch fish himself. Then Viraka
said, “Good friend, you do not belong to a
tribe of such crows as are born to go into water
and catch fish. Don’t destroy yourself!”</p>

<p class='c005'>But in spite of this attempt to dissuade him,
Savitthaka did not take the warning to heart.
<a id='Page_157'></a>Down he went to the pool, into the water; but
he could not make his way through the weeds
and come out again—there he was, entangled
in the weeds, with only the tip of his beak
appearing above the water. So not being able
to breathe he perished there beneath the water.</p>

<p class='c005'>His mate noticed that he did not return,
and went to Viraka to ask news of him. “My
Lord,” she asked, “Savitthaka is not to be seen:
where is he?” And as she asked him this, she
repeated the first stanza:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O have you seen Savitthaka, O Viraka, have you seen</div>
      <div class='line in2'>My sweet-voiced mate whose neck is like the peacock in its sheen?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>When Viraka heard it, he replied, “Yes, I
know where he is gone,” and recited the
second stanza:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“He was not born to dive beneath the wave,</div>

      <div class='line'><a id='Page_158'></a>So the poor bird has found a watery grave,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Entangled in the weeds, and left to die.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>When the lady-crow heard it, weeping, she
returned to Benares.</p>
<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 id='chap24' class='c003'>THE JUDAS TREE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Once upon a time Brahmadatta, the king
of Benares, had four sons. One day they
sent for the charioteer, and said to him:</p>

<p class='c005'>“We want to see a Judas tree; show us
one!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very well, I will,” the charioteer replied.
But he did not show it to them all together.
He took the eldest at once to the forest in the
chariot, and showed him the tree at the time
when the buds were just sprouting from the
stem. To the second he showed it when the
leaves were green, to the third at the time
of blossoming, and to the fourth when it was
bearing fruit.</p>

<p class='c005'>After this it happened that the four
brothers were sitting together, and some one
asked, “What sort of a tree is the Judas tree?”
Then the first brother answered:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Like a burnt stump!”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the second cried, “Like a banyan tree!”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_162'></a>And the third—“Like a piece of meat!”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the fourth said, “Like the acacia!”</p>

<p class='c005'>They were vexed at each other’s answers,
and ran to find their father. “My Lord,” they
asked, “what sort of a tree is the Judas tree?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What did you say to that?” he asked. They
told him the manner of their answers. Said
the king:</p>

<p class='c005'>“All four of you have seen the tree. Only
when the charioteer showed you the tree, you
did not ask him, 'What is the tree like at such
a time?’ or 'at such another time?’ You made
no distinctions, and that is the reason for your
mistake.” And he repeated the first stanza:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“All have seen the Judas tree—</div>
      <div class='line'>What is your perplexity?</div>
      <div class='line'>No one asked the charioteer</div>
      <div class='line'>What its form the livelong year!”</div>

  <h2 id='chap25' class='c003'>THE RIVER FISH AND THE MONEY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta
was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta
was born in the family of a landed proprietor.</p>

<p class='c005'>When he grew up, he became a wealthy
man. He had a young brother. Afterwards
their father died. They determined to arrange
some business of their father’s. This took
them to a village, where they were paid a
thousand pieces of money. On their way
back, as they waited on a river-bank for the
boat, they ate a meal out of a leaf-pottle. The
Bodhisatta threw what he left into the Ganges
for the fishes, giving the merit to the river-spirit.
The spirit accepted this with gratification,
which increased her divine power, and
on thinking over this increase of her power,
became aware what had happened. The
Bodhisatta laid his upper garment upon the
<a id='Page_166'></a>sand, and there he lay down and went to
sleep.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now the young brother was of a rather
thievish nature. He wanted to filch the money
from the Bodhisatta and keep it himself; so
he packed a parcel of gravel to look like the
parcel of money, and put them both away.</p>

<p class='c005'>When they had got aboard, and were come
to mid-river, the younger stumbled against the
side of the boat, and dropped overboard the
parcel of gravel, as he thought, but really the
money.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Brother, the money’s overboard!” he
cried. “What’s to be done?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What can we do? What’s gone is gone.
Never mind about it,” replied the other.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the river-spirit thought how pleased
she had been with the merit she had received,
and how her divine power had been increased,
and resolved to take care of his property. So
by her power she made a big-mouthed fish
swallow the parcel, and took care of it herself.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the thief got home, he chuckled over
the trick he had served his brother, and undid
<a id='Page_167'></a>the remaining parcel. There was nothing but
gravel to be seen! His heart dried up; he fell
on his bed, and clutched the bedstead.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now some fishermen just then cast their
nets for a draught. By power of the river-spirit,
this fish fell into the net. The fishers
took it to town to sell. People asked what the
price was.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A thousand pieces and seven annas,” said
the fishermen.</p>

<p class='c005'>Everybody made fun of them. “We have
seen a fish offered for a thousand pieces!” they
laughed.</p>

<p class='c005'>The fishers brought their fish to the Bodhisatta’s
door, and asked him to buy it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What’s the price?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You may have it for seven annas,” they
said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What did you ask other people for it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“From other people we asked a thousand
rupees and seven annas; but you may have it
for seven annas,” they said.</p>

<p class='c005'>He paid seven annas for it, and sent it to
his wife. She cut it open, and there was the
<a id='Page_168'></a>parcel of money! She called the Bodhisatta.
He gave a look, and recognizing his mark,
knew it for his own. Thought he, “These
fishers asked other people the price of a
thousand rupees and seven annas, but because
the thousand rupees were mine, they let me
have it for seven annas only! If a man does
not understand the meaning of this, nothing
will ever make him believe.”</p>

<p class='c005'>When he had said this, he wondered how
it was that he had recovered his money. At
the moment the river-spirit hovered invisibly
in the air, and declared—</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am the Spirit of the Ganges. You gave
the remains of your meal to the fishes, and let
me have the merit. Therefore I have taken
care of your property.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the Spirit told about the mean trick
which the younger brother had played. Then
she added, “There he lies, with his heart dried
up within him. There is no prosperity for the
cheat. But I have brought you your own,
and I warn you not to lose it. Don’t give
it to your young thief of a brother, but keep
it all yourself.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_169'></a>Thus spoke the Spirit, not wishing that the
treacherous villain should receive the money.
But the Bodhisatta said, “That is impossible,”
and all the same sent the brother five hundred.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_173'></a>
  <h2 id='chap26' class='c003'>THE DREAMER IN THE WOOD</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Now the Buddha once upon a time lived
alone in the woods, in the ecstasy of
meditation. For wild fruits he went no further
afield. When fruit grew upon the tree,
he ate the fruit; in time of flowers, he ate flowers.
When the leaves grew, he ate leaves.
When leaves were none, he ate the bark of
trees. Thus, in the highest contentment he
lived a long time in that place.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now on a day, Sakka, the King of the gods,
appeared before him and, wishing to test him,
said: “Behold yon man, all black of hue, my
spirit likes him not.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Now by his divine insight the Buddha knew
that Sakka spoke to him. And he made answer
and said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Though black of hue, I am a true Brahmin.
A man is not black by reason of his
outer skin; only can sin make him black.”
Thus he discoursed to Sakka, and it was as
he had made the moon to rise in the sky. And
<a id='Page_174'></a>the god asked him what boon he would crave.</p>

<p class='c005'>And the Divine being asked to be free of
three things: malice, hatred and greed.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Sakka: “What is bad in these
things?” And Buddha made answer, “Because
hatred grows from small to great and
is ever full of bitterness. Malice brings evil.
First word, then touch, next fist, then staff,
and last the swordstroke flashing free. When
men are urged by greed, then arise fraud and
deceit and swift pursuit of savage loot——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then,” said Sakka, “choose another boon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then said the Buddha, “Grant that in the
woods where I live alone, no disease may mar
my peace, or break my ecstasy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then said Sakka, “He chooseth no thing
connected with food.” And he granted yet
another boon.</p>

<p class='c005'>And the Buddha said, “Let no creature ever
be harmed for me in body or in mind.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And Sakka made the tree bear fruit perennially,
and saluting the Buddha by touching
his head with joined hands, he said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dwell here for ever free from disease,”
and returned to his throne.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_177'></a>
  <h2 id='chap27' class='c003'>THE RICE MEASURE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Long ago, Brahmadatta was king in
Benares, in the land of Kāsi. At that
time our Bodisat was his valuer. He valued
both horses, elephants, or things of that kind;
and jewelry, gold, or things of that kind; and
having done so, he used to have the proper
price for the goods given to the owners thereof.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now the King was covetous. And in his
avarice he thought, “If this valuer estimates
in this way, it will not be long before all the
wealth in my house will come to an end. I
will appoint another valuer.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And opening his window, and looking out
into the palace yard, he saw a stupid miserly
peasant crossing the yard. Him he determined
to make his valuer; and sending for him,
asked if he would undertake the office. The
man said he could; and the King, with the
object of keeping his treasure safer, established
that fool in the post of valuer.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_178'></a>Thenceforward the dullard used to value
the horses and elephants, paying no regard
to their real value, but deciding just as he
chose; and since he had been appointed to the
office, as he decided, so the price was.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now at that time a horse-dealer brought
five hundred horses from the northern prairies.
The King sent for that fellow, and had
the horses valued. And he valued the five
hundred horses at a mere measure of rice, and
straightway ordered the horse-dealer to be
given the measure of rice, and the horses to
be lodged in the stable. Then the horse-dealer
went to the former valuer, and told
him what had happened, and asked him what
he should do.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Give a bribe to that fellow,” said he, “and
ask him thus: 'We know now that so many
horses of ours are worth a measure of rice,
but we want to know from you what a measure
of rice is worth. Can you value it for us,
standing in your place by the King?’ If he
says he can, go with him into the royal presence,
and I will be there too.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The horse-dealer accepted the Bodisat’s
<a id='Page_179'></a>advice, went to the valuer, and bribed him,
and gave him the hint suggested. And he
took the bribe, and said, “All right! I can
value your measure of rice for you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, then, let us go to the audience-hall,”
said he; and taking him with him, went into
the King’s presence. And the Bodisat and
many other ministers went there also.</p>

<p class='c005'>The horse-dealer bowed down before the
King, and said, “I acknowledge, O King, that
a measure of rice is the value of the five
hundred horses; but will the King be pleased
to ask the valuer what the value of the measure
of rice may be?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The King, not knowing what had happened,
asked, “How now, valuer, <i>what</i> are five hundred
horses worth?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“A measure of rice, O King!” said he.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very good, then! If five hundred horses
are worth only a measure of rice, what is that
measure of rice worth?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The measure of rice is worth all Benares,
both within and without the walls,” replied
that foolish fellow.</p>

<p class='c005'>For the story goes that he first valued the
<a id='Page_180'></a>horses at a measure of rice just to please the
King; and then, when he had taken the dealer’s
bribe, valued that measure of rice at the whole
of Benares. Now at that time the circumference
of the rampart of Benares was twelve
leagues, and the land in its suburbs was three
hundred leagues in extent. Yet the foolish
fellow estimated that so-great city of Benares,
together with all its suburbs, at a measure of
rice!</p>

<p class='c005'>Hearing this the ministers clapped their
hands, laughing, and saying, “We used to
think the broad earth, and the King’s realm,
were alike beyond price; but this great and
famous royal city is worth, by his account,
just a measure of rice! O the depth of the
wisdom of the valuer! How can he have
stayed so long in office? Truly he is just
suited to our King!” Thus they laughed him
to scorn.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the Bodisat uttered this stanza:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“What is a measure of rice worth?</div>
      <div class='line'>All Benares and its environs!</div>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_181'></a>And what are five hundred horses worth?</div>
      <div class='line'>That same measure of rice!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Then the king was ashamed, and drove out
that fool, and appointed the Bodisat to the
office of valuer. And in course of time the
Bodisat passed away according to his deeds.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_185'></a>
  <h2 id='chap28' class='c003'>THE POISONOUS TREES</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was
reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was
born a merchant. When he grew up, and was
trading with five hundred wagons, he came
one day to where the road led through a great
forest. Halting at the outskirts, he mustered
the caravan and addressed them thus:—“Poison-trees
grow in this forest. Take heed
that you taste no unfamiliar leaf, flower, or
fruit without first consulting me.” All promised
to take every care; and the journey into
the forest began. Now just within the forest-border
stands a village, and just outside that
village grows a What-fruit tree. That What-fruit
tree exactly resembles a mango alike in
trunk, branch, leaf, flower, and fruit. And
not only in outward semblance, but also in
taste and smell, the fruit—ripe and unripe—mimics
the mango. If eaten, it is a deadly
poison, and causes instant death.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_186'></a>Now some greedy fellows, who went on
ahead of the caravan, came to this tree and,
taking it to be a mango, ate of its fruit. But
others said, “Let us ask our leader before we
eat”; and they accordingly halted by the tree,
fruit in hand, till he came up. Perceiving
that it was no mango, he said:—“This 'mango’
is a What-fruit tree; don’t touch its fruit.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Having stopped them from eating, the
Bodhisatta turned his attention to those who
had already eaten. First he dosed them with
an emetic, and then he gave them the four
sweet foods to eat; so that in the end they
recovered.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now on former occasions caravans had
halted beneath this same tree, and had died
from eating the poisonous fruit which they
mistook for mangoes. On the morrow the
villagers would come, and seeing them lying
there dead, would fling them by the heels into
a secret place, departing with all the belongings
of the caravan, wagons and all.</p>

<p class='c005'>And on the day too of our story these
villagers failed not to hurry at daybreak to
the tree for their expected spoils. “The oxen
<a id='Page_187'></a>must be ours,” said some. “And we’ll have
the wagons,” said others;—whilst others
again claimed the wares as their share. But
when they came breathless to the tree, there
was the whole caravan alive and well!</p>

<p class='c005'>“How came you to know this was not a
mango tree?” demanded the disappointed villagers.
“We didn’t know,” said they of the
caravan; “it was our leader who knew.”</p>

<p class='c005'>So the villagers came to the Bodhisatta and
said, “Man of wisdom, what did you do to
find out this tree was not a mango?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Two things told me,” replied the Bodhisatta,
and he repeated this stanza:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When near a village grows a tree</div>
      <div class='line'>Not hard to climb, ’tis plain to me,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor need I further proof to know,</div>
      <div class='line'>—No wholesome fruit thereon can grow!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>And having taught the Truth to the assembled
multitude, he finished his journey in
safety.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_191'></a>
  <h2 id='chap29' class='c003'>THE WELL-TRAINED ELEPHANT</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Once upon a time when King Magadha
was ruling in Rajagaha in Magadha, the
Bodhisatta was born an elephant. He was
white all over and graced with all beauty.
And because of his beauty the King made him
his state elephant.</p>

<p class='c005'>One festal day the King adorned the city
like a city of the devas and, mounted on the
elephant in all its trappings, made a solemn
procession round the city attended by a great
retinue. And all along the route the people
were moved by the sight of that peerless elephant
to exclaim, “Oh, what a stately gait!
what proportions! what beauty! what grace!
such a white elephant is worthy of an universal
monarch.” All this praise of his elephant
awoke the King’s jealousy and he resolved to
have it cast over a precipice and killed. So
he summoned the mahout and asked whether
he called that a trained elephant.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_192'></a>“Indeed he is well trained, Sire,” said the
mahout. “No, he is very badly trained.”
“Sire, he is well trained.” “If he is so well
trained, can you get him to climb to the summit
of Mount Vepulla?” “Yes, Sire.” “Away
with you, then,” said the King. And he got
down from the elephant, making the mahout
mount instead, and went himself to the foot
of the mountain, whilst the mahout rode on
the elephant’s back up to the top of Mount
Vepulla. The King with his courtiers also
climbed the mountain, and had the elephant
halted at the brink of a precipice. “Now,”
said he to the man, “if he is so well trained as
you say, make him stand on three legs.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the mahout on the elephant’s back just
touched the animal with his goad by way of
sign and called to him, “Hi! my beauty, stand
on three legs.” “Now make him stand on his
two fore-legs,” said the King. And the Great
Being raised his hind-legs and stood on his
fore-legs alone. “Now on the hind-legs,” said
the King, and the obedient elephant raised his
fore-legs till he stood on his hind-legs alone.
<a id='Page_193'></a>“Now on one leg,” said the King, and the elephant
stood on one leg.</p>

<p class='c005'>Seeing that the elephant did not fall over
the precipice, the King cried, “Now if you can,
make him stand in the air.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then thought the mahout to himself, “All
India cannot show the match of this elephant
for excellence of training. Surely the King
must want to make him tumble over the precipice
and meet his death.” So he whispered
in the elephant’s ear, “My son, the King wants
you to fall over and get killed. He is not
worthy of you. If you have power to journey
through the air, rise up with me upon your
back and fly through the air to Benares.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the Great Being, endowed as he was
with the marvelous powers which flow from
Merit, straightway rose up into the air. Then
said the mahout, “Sire, this elephant, possessed
as he is with the marvelous powers
which flow from Merit, is too good for such a
worthless fool as you: none but a wise and
good King is worthy to be his master. When
those who are so worthless as you get an elephant
<a id='Page_194'></a>like this, they don’t know his value, and
so they lose their elephant, and all the rest of
their glory and splendor.” So saying the
mahout, seated on the elephant’s neck, recited
this stanza:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Exalted station breeds a fool great woe;</div>
      <div class='line'>He proves his own and others’ mortal foe.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“And now, good-by,” said he to the King
as he ended this rebuke; and rising in the air,
he passed to Benares and halted in mid-air,
over the royal courtyard. And there was a
great stir in the city and all cried out, “Look
at the state-elephant that has come through
the air for our King and is hovering over the
royal courtyard.” And with all haste the news
was conveyed to the King, too, who came out
and said, “If your coming is for my behoof,
alight on the earth.” And the Bodhisatta
descended from the air. Then the mahout got
down and bowed before the King, and in answer
to the King’s enquiries told the whole
story of their leaving Rajagaha. “It was very
good of you,” said the King, “to come here”;
<a id='Page_195'></a>and in his joy he had the city decorated and
the elephant installed in his state-stable. Then
he divided his kingdom into three portions,
and made over one to the Bodhisatta, one to
the mahout, and one he kept himself. And
his power grew from the day of the Bodisatta’s
coming till all India owned his
sovereign sway. As Emperor of India, he
was charitable and did other good works till
he passed away to fare according to his deserts.</p>

asking them to give her medicine for it. But
a Buddhist mendicant, thinking, “She does
not understand,” said to her: “My good girl,
I myself have no such medicine as you ask
for, but I think I know of one who has.” “Oh,
tell me who that is!” said Kisāgotamī. “The
Buddha can give you medicine: go to him,”
was the answer.</p>

<p class='c005'>She went to Gautama, and doing homage
to him, said: “Lord and Master, do you know
any medicine that will be good for my child?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, I know of some,” said the Teacher.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_200'></a>Now it was the custom for patients or their
friends to provide the herbs which the doctors
required, so she asked what herbs he would
want. “I want some mustard-seed,” he said;
and when the poor girl eagerly promised to
bring some of so common a drug, he added:
“You must get it from some house where
no son, or husband, or parent, or slave has
died.” “Very good,” she said, and went to
ask for it, still carrying her dead child with
her. The people said: “Here is mustard-seed,
take it.” But when she asked, “In my friend’s
house has any son died, or a husband, or a
parent, or slave?” they answered: “Lady!
what is this that thou sayest; the living are
few, but the dead are many.” Then she went
to other houses, but one said: “I have lost
a son”; another, “We have lost our parents”;
another, “I have lost my slave.”</p>

<p class='c005'>At last, not being able to find a single
house where no one had died, her mind began
to clear, and, summoning up resolution, she
left the dead body of her child in a forest,
and returning to the Buddha paid him homage.
He said to her: “Have you the mustard-seed?”
<a id='Page_201'></a>“My Lord,” she replied, “I have not;
the people tell me that the living are few, but
the dead are many.” Then he talked to her
on that essential part of his system—the
impermanency of all things, till her doubts
were cleared away, and, accepting her lot, she
became a disciple and entered the first Path.</p>

<p class='c009'>The following lines, ascribed to some of her Sisters
in the Order and given in the <i>Psalms</i> (translated by
Mrs. Rhys Davids), would apply to Kisāgotamī:—</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>NOTES FOR TEACHERS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>The following notes are intended for teachers who
may wish to use this collection as a class text book.
In all these stories we have the idea of the Indian God
in various re-incarnations until he has attained full
Buddhahood. Beyond occasionally mentioning the fact
of Re-birth in introducing the story (so as to preserve
the Oriental flavor) I do not insist on this, nor do I
introduce the name of the Buddha into the actual table
of contents at the beginning of the book, as it might
seem abstruse to the younger readers. But because I
wish to appeal to scholars in the higher sense as well as
to boys and girls, I have tried in many instances to
preserve the language as given in the translation from
the Pali. I have also tried to avoid cutting out any
important episodes; this sometimes happens in the popular
adaptation of these deeply ethical stories. I have
tried to keep as far as possible the Eastern point of
view, since the book is sponsored by one of the foremost
of Oriental Scholars, Dr. Rhys Davids, who has helped
me with his advice, and taught me the spirit of the
whole conception.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE HARE THAT RAN AWAY</h3>
<p class='c004'>This is the only story I have completely re-adapted
for quite small children, and I have found it among the
<a id='Page_204'></a>most popular. I often tell it in connection with Hans
C. Andersen’s story of the “Scandal in the Poultry
Yard,” of which the subject is practically the same:
the first being simple and direct, the second veiled in
gentle satire.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE MONKEY AND THE CROCODILE</h3>
<p class='c004'>I include this story because of the lighter side and
because we cannot hide from our boys and girls that
craft does enter into the question of success as the world
understands it. It is, however, in my mind where the
Buddha is not at his highest level. Perhaps the less
this story is explained the better.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE SPIRIT THAT LIVED IN A TREE</h3>
<p class='c004'>This story I consider to be one of the most beautiful
in the collection. We cannot baldly appeal to the children
to think “of the next generation,” but this wonderful
picture must fire their imagination where the ordinary
didactic appeal might fail.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE HARE THAT WAS NOT AFRAID TO DIE</h3>
<p class='c004'>In this story it may be necessary to make a few words
of comment on the point of view of the Buddha which
might not be quite intelligible to the child. The fact,
that though he was ready to sacrifice his own body he
had a care for the tiny insects which might perish with
him, has much significance in the story scheme. It
shows not only the letter of the law but the spirit of the
<a id='Page_205'></a>love which prompted him to act, and represents one of
the principal tenets of the Buddhist Faith. The whole
story is somewhat remote from modern life, but I have
found it of great interest to children of different ages,
most especially at the time when Fast Days were
called for.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE PARROT THAT FED HIS PARENTS</h3>
<p class='c004'>The dramatic interest of this story appeals to all
ages. I have found quite young children enthralled by
the adventures of the parrot. I take exception to the
lack of poetic justice in the kinsfolk sharing the parrot’s
reward—but it was necessary to the Buddha’s happiness,
and if children should raise the question, I
should explain it on that ground.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE MAN WHO WORKED TO GIVE ALMS</h3>
<p class='c004'>The method of alms-giving may not appeal to modern
feeling, but the spirit in which the gifts were made
rises to wonderful heights, and the deeds are sanctified
by the self-sacrifice which brings them about. In telling
this story to groups of boys and girls accustomed
to the warnings of charity organizations, the different
conditions in the East might be mentioned.</p>

<p class='c005'>We have here the same idea as in the story of the
King who gave his eyes. This story seems to lead up
to the other, in which the sacrifice is so much greater.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE KING WHO SAW THE TRUTH</h3>
<p class='c004'>This story may seem at first to be above the plane
of the young child. I have eliminated all the physical
<a id='Page_206'></a>suffering, because it is not necessary to bring out the
real meaning of the story. Older children (whether in
years or understanding) will be able to appreciate the
beauty of the sacrifice and the exceeding greatness of
the reward.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE BULL THAT DEMANDED FAIR TREATMENT</h3>
<p class='c004'>The fact that the Buddha insists on a fair wage, not
from selfish greed but for the sake of his employer, lifts
the story from the realm of the commonplace which the
subject might suggest.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE BULL THAT PROVED HIS GRATITUDE</h3>
<p class='c004'>An excellent illustration for children of the necessity
of kindness to animals, not only from the merciful
point of view, but from the practical question of ensuring
good work.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE HORSE THAT HELD OUT TO THE END</h3>
<p class='c004'>The children will be much impressed by the courage
of the horse, and the power of will he shows in accomplishing
the task he has set himself. It is the spirit of
the soldier at its best and might be cited as displayed
during the Great War by individuals from all nations.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE MONKEY THAT SAVED THE HERD</h3>
<p class='c004'>This is one of the most practical stories in the collection,
showing that for success in leadership it is necessary
<a id='Page_207'></a>to have a quiet mind, a great deal of knowledge,
and a firm belief in success. This is the way ogres are
outwitted. The frank laying down of his cards, his
open declaration of his plans to the enemy, present the
Bodisat at his best.</p>

<p class='c005'>There is an unconscious note of humor in this tale,
in presenting a monkey as possessed of such complete
self-control as to be able to bring about so great a
miracle, but if any explanation is offered in the telling
of these tales, it should be that, whatever the outward
form, the Buddha preserves the attribute of a god.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE MALLARD THAT ASKED FOR TOO MUCH</h3>
<p class='c004'>Origin of the “Goose that laid the Golden Eggs”;
Pali word for golden goose is Hansa, whence Gans,
goose.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE MERCHANT WHO OVERCAME ALL OBSTACLES</h3>
<p class='c004'>For encouraging a spirit of enterprise, and courage
under difficulties, this is an admirable story. I think
both boys and girls will apply it (unconsciously) in
their everyday undertakings, but this will depend largely
on the manner in which it is told: it must appeal to
the imagination through the dramatic presentation.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE ELEPHANT THAT WAS HONORED IN OLD AGE</h3>
<p class='c004'>A splendid example of the honor we ought to show
to those old people in the community who have done
<a id='Page_208'></a>really good work. This story might be taken in connection
with stories from history illustrating the same point.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE FAITHFUL FRIEND</h3>
<p class='c004'>A story which will encourage children’s interest in
animals and their characteristics, and will increase their
interest in observing the ways of those animals under
their care.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE HAWK AND THE OSPREY</h3>
<p class='c004'>This story should be told as dramatically as possible,
because it is full of action and will hold the children
quite breathless. The little touch of the lion objecting
at first to be roused at an unreasonable hour is delightfully
human, and the fact that when he realizes the
necessity he is ready to help, is worthy of his high position
among the animals.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>GRANDMOTHER’S GOLDEN DISH</h3>
<p class='c004'>This story is specially useful because since <i>rogues</i>
are so often successful in the ordinary sense, and we
are bound to admit this ordinary success, it is well
that a graphic description of the triumph of honesty
should be presented to children which will at once appeal
to their sense of fairness.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE ELEPHANT THAT SPARED LIFE</h3>
<p class='c004'>This may seem a little too lofty for the children, but
I think it well to include a few stories where the standard
<a id='Page_209'></a>may seem too high and the action quixotic. In later
years they will realize the philosophy of the story, but
the dramatic interest will appeal at once.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>HOW THE ANTELOPE WAS CAUGHT</h3>
<p class='c004'>This is an admirable treatise on the relative value of
things which children are quick to see. It should be told
with increasing dramatic force up to the final run of the
foolish antelope who has sacrificed his liberty to his
greed.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE BANYAN DEER</h3>
<p class='c004'>This is one of the most beautiful of all the Jataka
stories. I have given the whole as translated from the
Buddhist Birth Stories, only leaving out parts of the
description. Any curtailed edition of the action of this
story, leaving out the tenderness of the Bodisat for the
deer that is “with young,” robs the story of its most
beautiful meaning.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE PUPIL WHO TAUGHT HIS TEACHER</h3>
<p class='c004'>This is a healthy idea and one which should commend
itself to the young who are naturally averse to the idea
of Death. It is the opposite of the idea: Whom the
gods love, die young.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE MAN WHO TOLD A LIE</h3>
<p class='c004'>In this story, if it is considered injudicious to tell
children of the hypocrisy of the teacher and the priest,
<a id='Page_210'></a>the title of the man could be left out. For my part, and
from experience as a teacher, I have always found it
wise to admit and condemn the same faults in teachers
and preachers as in the laity, but to point out to the
children that those same faults are the more reprehensible
because of the profession which is degraded by
such people as the false priest.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE CROW THAT THOUGHT IT KNEW</h3>
<p class='c004'>This story shows the power of the skilled workman.
The one who was not skilled thought he could do more
than he had the power to do, and came to grief.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE JUDAS TREE</h3>
<p class='c004'>The point of this story is the impossibility of a just
judgment without full knowledge of your subject. Each
one has only a partial knowledge and is therefore excluded
from the knowledge of the whole.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE RIVER FISH AND THE MONEY</h3>
<p class='c004'>The power of honesty restores the lost treasure. The
Bodisatta is not anxious about it, preserves his calm, and
recovers it. Observe the way in which he keeps only the
money which belongs to him, refusing to withhold it from
the dishonest man.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE DREAMER IN THE WOOD</h3>
<p class='c004'>I have hesitated to include this story as beyond the
range of children but I leave it for the abnormal child
who may value the joy of solitude.</p>
<div>
  <a id='Page_211'></a>
  <h3 class='c015'>THE RICE MEASURE</h3>
</div>
<p class='c004'>The King falls easily into the trap that is laid for
him. His craving for greed leads him to appoint a fool
and the fool leads to his failure.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE POISONOUS TREES</h3>
<p class='c004'>Here we have the skill of knowledge. The Bodisatta
knows how to distinguish the mango tree from the What-fruit
tree, and to save the life of those who had eaten
therefrom.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE WELL-TRAINED ELEPHANT</h3>
<p class='c004'>Here we have the Bodisatta ready to do the miracle
that he may convince the King that he is unworthy to
possess him. The whole picture is very striking and the
story lends itself to dramatic effect.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE WISE PHYSICIAN</h3>
<p class='c004'>I am indebted to Sir Robert Morant, K.C.B., who has
kindly been interested in the preparation of my book
as a whole, for the suggestion that I should include this
story (although it is not one of the series of Buddha
Re-Birth Stories to which all the others belong), also
for the reminder of this special version—namely, the
woman’s own recognition, through her personal experience,
of the impermanence of those things which seem
to be lasting.</p>

<p class='c005'>I should not suggest this story as one which would
appeal to children. I have included it for “children of
<a id='Page_212'></a>larger growth” as embodying one of the important tenets
of the Buddhist Faith, and as showing how personal
grief may be assuaged in gaining sympathy with the
sorrow of others.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
